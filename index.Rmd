# General Research problem

--
## Income inequality could have a significant effect on social cohesion and instability, spreading its influence like a *disease*

--

(Brunori, Ferreira, & Peragine, 2013; R. Kanbur, 2005; S. M. R. Kanbur & Venables, 2005; Milanovic, 2016; Ocampo, 2004)

--

## The issue of inequality has taken a secondary place in the design of economic policy compared to efficiency measures such as Economic Growth

--

 <!-- + Among **consequences**:
  + **Unemployment**, **increasing fiscal expenses**, **indebtedness** and **political instability** (Berg & Ostry,2011). 
  + **crime rates**, **teenage pregnancy**, **obesity**, and **fewer opportunities** to invest in health and education(Atkinson, 2015). 
  + Inequality of opportunities hampers **social and economic mobility**, **trust** and **social cohesion**.
  + Slow down **economic growth** by making it less inclusive and sustainable -->

# Natural Resources: Curse or Blessing?  <br> Evidence on the Spatial Dimension of Income Inequality at the County Level in Chile

---

# Research so far

 <!-- + **Reporting a phenomenon of increasing inequality** (Berg & Ostry, 2017; Ostry, Berg, & Tsangarides, 2014; Cingano, 2014; OECD, 2014). --> 

+ **Causes of income inequality** include **levels of income at initial stages** of economic development (Kuznets, 1955), **Globalization** (Milanovic, 2016), **Skill-biased technological change** (Tinbergen, 1975), investment in **human capital** (Murphy & Topel, 2016), **Institutions**, **redistributive policy** and **country-specific characteristics** (Acemoglu, 1995, 2002; Acemoglu et al., 2001a, 2001c)

</span></div> 

### The endowment of natural resources can influence inequality by:
+ Determining its **initial levels** (Engerman & Sokoloff, 1994, 1997; Engerman, Sokoloff, Urquiola, & Acemoglu, 2002), 
+ Shaping the evolution of **institutions** (Acemoglu, 2002), 
+ Dumbing the **educational system** and moulding the **structure of economic activity** (Leamer, Maul, Rodriguez, & Schott, 1999)
+ **Rent-seeking**, **delays in manufacturing and technology adoption** and **lower incentives for investment in physical and human capital** (Gylfason & Zoega, 2003).
+ Impact on economic growth (**“Natural Resource Curse Hypothesis”**) 
+ Effect on social cohesion and instability, spreading its influence like a **disease**

# Research so far

### Evidence for the Chilean economy has documented
+ High and persistent levels of income inequality
+ Significant spatial dimension (Aroca & Bosch, 2000; Paredes, Iturra, & Lufin, 2016)

--

### About the relevance of the spatial dimension
+ **Decomposing general indicators of inequality**. Evidence from countries including the US (Doran & Jordan, 2016), China (Akita, 2003; Gustafsson & Shi, 2002; Ye, Ma,Ye, Chen, & Xie, 2017; Yue, Zhang, Ye, Cheng, & Leipnik, 2014), Japan (Ohtake, 2008), South Africa (Leibbrandt, Finn, & Woolard, 2012) and Chile (Paredes et al., 2016).

--

+ Using **spatial methods** to analyse the nature of the spatial effects:
  + **Spatial heterogeneity** (different relationships in distinct locations)
  + **Spatial dependence** (cross-sectional interactions such as spillover
effects among units from distinct locations)

#### What do we mean by "spatial approach"?


+ Mapping the spatial distribution of the [variable](#gini-nrd-maps)

--

+ Defining the relevant neighborhood for each county (matrix **W**).

--

+ Testing the significance of the spatial patterns (Spatial Autocorrelation)

--

+ Checking whether the clustering pattern in inequality is the result of a process of spatial dependence in the variable itself or it can be explained by other variables:

--

  + Run an OLS regression of Gini against NRD and controls

--

  + Test for spatial autocorrelation in the OLS residuals

--

+ Using spatial models to find the spatial structure that best fits the clustering process of income inequality after controlling for other variables

--

  + Spatial cross-sectional models
  + Spatial static panel models

## Spatial Model Specification (Cross-Sectional)

The model could be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
y=\lambda Wy+X\beta+WX\gamma+u
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
u=\rho Wu+\varepsilon
\end{equation}

+ $W$ is our weight matrix that works as a NxN spatial lag operator (**Spatial Lag**: Weighted sum of the values observed at neighboring locations) 

+ Thus, the parameter: 
  + $\lambda$ capture the influence of the spatial lag for the dependent variable, $Wy$,
  + $\gamma$ capture the influence of the spatial lag for the explanatory variables, $WX$, 
  + $\rho$ capture the influence of the spatial lag for the errors, $Wu$,
  + $\epsilon$ is a vector of idiosyncratic errors.

# Discussion and Recomendations

+ Contrary to our main hypothesis, NRD shows a significant and negative association with income inequality.  

--

+ This result is robust to the type of analysis (cross-sectional vs panel data), the approach (spatial vs nonspatial) and the inclusion of different controls.

--

+ Implication: The downward trend in the
participation of the primary sector in terms of employment in the Chilean economy could be one of the main reasons explaining the high persistence in the levels of income inequality.

--

+ Policies oriented to transform the structure of local economies to less dependent ones on natural resources will generate additional challenges for local and central governments in their attemps to reduce inequality  

--

+ Education and municipal expenditure seem to be effective policy tools aiming to reduce inequality in Chile.

# Limitations and Future Research

### Limitations
+ Data availability at the county level
+ Results do not allow us to make causal inferences about the effect of NRD on income inequality
+ Results are sensitive to the specification of the spatial weights

### Future Research
+ "Innovative" ways to define "distance" and W.
+ Incorporate measures of commuting and migration between counties.
+ Using measures of NRD as instrument for income inequality in studies about its consequences.

  + Pursuing equality can reduce efficiency (see Okun 1975; Browning & Johnson 1984; Andersen & Maibom 2016)   

--

???
Why (how) can inequality influence LGE?:
- General reasons argued for most of the contextual factors are:
  + It influences competition among municipalities
  + It affects degree of monitoring over local authorities
  + It affects degree of incentives to perform efficiently (Paradox of Plenty, RCH)
  + Existence of economies or diseconomies of scale in the provision of public services

- Additionally for the case of inequality:
  + It is used to capture the degree of heterogeneity in the demands that county population exerts over local authorities
  + Small richest groups can exert a higher influence over local authorities (priorities) resulting in low quality and quantity of services for most of the county population.
  + Lower inequality with high mean income should be associated with a higher monitoring and demand for an efficient performance from tax payers (not only "the richest group").

# Discussion and Recomendations

## Main results

--

+ **DEA**
  + The "production function" of municipalities shows variable returns to scale.
  + The average level of inefficiency is 17%, with higher levels in the South area of the country.
  + Efficiency shows a ciclical behaviour and, on average, has remained stable in the period 2006 - 2017.

--

+ **Regression analysis**
  + Empirical **evidence of a negative relationship between inequality and efficiency**, that is, a reduction of income inequality (or an increase in equality) could have positive effects on economic efficiency, at least at the level of local governments.

>Incivilities are those visible disorders in the public space that violate respectful social norms and tend not to be treated as crimes by the criminal justice system

--

There two types of incivilities:
+ **Social incivilities** include antisocial behaviours such as public drinking, noisy neighbours, fighting in public places and street drug sales. 
+ **Physical incivilities** include, among others, vandalism, graffiti, abandoned cars and garbage on the streets.

+ **Health problems** (Branas et al., 2011; Cohenet al., 2000; Hill & Angel, 2005; Ross, 2011; Ross & Mirowsky, 2001)

--

+ **Greater victimization** and **fear of crime** (Brunton-Smith, Jackson, & Sutherland, 2014; Mijanovich & Weitzman, 2003)

--

+ Multiple negative **economic effects**:
  + Reduction in commercial activity, lower investment in real state and reduction in house prices (Skogan, 2015)
  + Population instability (Hipp, 2010).

#### The "Incivilities Thesis"

>Incivilities are caused by inequality and the lack of informal mechanisms of social control. The patterns of incivilities should mirror the patterns of inequality (Taylor, 1999)

--

#### Chilean evidence: 
+ Focussed on crime and showing weak and ambiguous results
  + **Indicators of socio-economic disadvantage** would only have significant effects on property crime (Beyer & Vergara, 2006; Nuñez, Rivera, Villavicencio, & Molina, 2003; Rivera, Gutiérrez, & Núñez,2009). 
  + **Crime deterrence variables**: The probability of being caught or the number of police resources (Beyer & Vergara, 2006; Rivera et al., 2009; Vergara, 2012).

In Chile there is no evidence about causes of incivilities, but the BRoken Windows Theory has been used to argue new punitive actions to reduce crime, victimization and the feeling of insecutity in the population

# Research Hypoteses


> $H_1$: Incivilities will be higher in counties with high levels of inequality.  

&NewLine;

--

> $H_2$: Incivilities will be higher in counties with a high proportion of the young population.

&NewLine;
--

> $H_3$: Incivilities will be higher in counties with a high proportion of foreign inhabitants.

&NewLine;
--

> $H_4$: Incivilities will be lower in counties managed by municipalities more autonomous from central government transfers.

In general, the relationship (effect) with incivilities depend on whether the variable is associated with a higher (lower) reported rate and/or whether it associated with a higher "probability to commit negligent or antisocial behaviour" (reduction in informal control)

# Data

+ Data on the number of **incivilities** were obtained from the **“Centre of Studies and Analysis of Crime”** (Chilean government) 

+ Dependent variable:

\begin{equation}
inciv\_rate=\frac{incivilities_{it}}{n_{it}}*1000;
\end{equation}

  + Where $inciv\_rate$ is the incivilities rate, $t$ is the year, $i$ the county and $n$ is the population of the county per year.

+ Independent variable:
  + The **Gini coefficient** is calculated for each county
and included through the variable _gini_.

# Method: Panel Count Data models

+ Considering as the response variable the count of incivilities:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{it} =exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1gini_{it} + X\gamma+\alpha_i +\theta_t)
\end{equation}

--

+ where
  + $\lambda$ is the rate of incivilities, 
  + $X$ is our vector of controls, 
  + $\alpha's$ are county-specific constants and 
  + $\theta's$ are time-specific constants. 

--

+ To account for differences in county population, we have:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda_{it}}{(\frac{population_{it}}{1000})} =exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1gini_{it} + X\gamma+\alpha_i +\theta_t)
\end{equation}

+ The model estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is:

\begin{equation}
log(\lambda_{it}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1gini_{it} + X\gamma+\alpha_i +\theta_t+log(\frac{population_{it}}{1000})
\end{equation}

# Discussion and Recomendations

+ We found strong evidence of a **significant and positive association between the rate of incivilities and income inequality**. 

--

+ Policies aimed at controlling the behaviour of **young people** do not have strong empirical support. 

+ The significant increase in the **foreign population** seems to be associated with a significant increase in the problem of incivilities. 

--

+ Efforts managed from the municipalities can be an important complement to those from the central government.

--

+ Mayors supported by “LEFT” oriented political parties face higher challenges in terms of incivilities than those independent or RIGHT supported mayors.

# Conclusions and Future Research

+ Increasing income inequality or persistently high levels might be associated with the rise of antisocial behaviours in the form of incivilities. 

--

+ Future research should go further on the role of local authorities analysing the impact of specific programs in counties with similar characteristics.

--

+ Program evaluation could help to elucidate the question of whether local interventions from the local governments have a causal effect on incivilities and crime rates. 

--

+ A deeper analysis of the impact that foreign migration is having on social cohesion in the Chilean society is an interesting avenue for future studies
