# General Research problem

--

.left[Extant literature has documented as potential negative consequences of increasing inequality:
]

--

.left[
+ **Unemployment**, **increasing fiscal expenses**, **indebtedness** and **political instability** (Berg & Ostry,2011).   
+ **Crime rates**, **health** and **education** (Atkinson, 2015). 
+ **Social and economic mobility** and **trust**.
+ Slow down **economic growth** by making it less inclusive and sustainable.
]

## Income inequality could have a significant effect on social cohesion and instability, spreading its influence like a *disease*

--

.left[However, inequality still occupies a **secondary role** in the design of economic policy]

???
+ The above is reflected in:
  - justifications to delay reforms
  - data availability
+ The main contribution of this research: Better understanding of the causes and consecuences of income inequality in NRRC

# Research so far

 <!-- + **Reporting a phenomenon of increasing inequality** (Berg & Ostry, 2017; Ostry, Berg, & Tsangarides, 2014; Cingano, 2014; OECD, 2014). --> 

**Sources (causes) of income inequality** include: 

--

+ **Globalization** (Milanovic, 2016),

--

+ **Skill-biased technological change** (Tinbergen, 1975), 

--

+ Investment in **physical and human capital** (Murphy & Topel, 2016; Gylfason & Zoega, 2003),

--

+ **Institutions**, **redistributive policy** and **country-specific characteristics** (Acemoglu, 1995, 2002; Acemoglu et al., 2001a, 2001c)

--

+ **Endowment of natural resources** (Engerman & Sokoloff, 1994, 1997; Engerman, Sokoloff, Urquiola, & Acemoglu, 2002; Leamer, Maul, Rodriguez, & Schott, 1999)

--

**Evidence for the Chilean economy** has documented

--

+ **High and persistent** levels of **income inequality** with **significant geographical differences** (Aroca & Bosch, 2000; Paredes, Iturra, & Lufin, 2016)

About the relevance of the spatial dimension

+ **Decomposing general indicators of inequality**. Evidence from countries including the US (Doran & Jordan, 2016), China (Akita, 2003; Gustafsson & Shi, 2002; Ye, Ma,Ye, Chen, & Xie, 2017; Yue, Zhang, Ye, Cheng, & Leipnik, 2014), Japan (Ohtake, 2008), South Africa (Leibbrandt, Finn, & Woolard, 2012) and Chile (Paredes et al., 2016).

+ Using **spatial methods** to analyse the nature of the spatial effects:
  + **Spatial heterogeneity** (different relationships in distinct locations)

  + **Spatial dependence** (cross-sectional interactions such as spillover
effects among units from distinct locations)

## Spatial Model Specification (Cross-Sectional)

The model could be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
y=\lambda Wy+X\beta+WX\gamma+u
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
u=\rho Wu+\varepsilon
\end{equation}

--

+ $W$ is our weight matrix that works as a NxN spatial lag operator (**Spatial Lag**: Weighted sum of the values observed at neighboring locations) 

--

+ Thus, the parameter: 

--

  + $\lambda$ capture the influence of the spatial lag for the dependent variable, $Wy$ (Spatial Autoregressive Model, **SAR**)

--

  + $\gamma$ capture the influence of the spatial lag for the explanatory variables, $WX$ (**SLX** model) 

--

  + $\rho$ capture the influence of the spatial lag for the errors, $Wu$ (Spatial Error Model, **SEM**)

--

  + $\epsilon$ is a vector of idiosyncratic errors.

Interpretation:
A reduction in NRD (pss) in 10 percentage points will increase income inequality in 0.02. So, if Gini was 0.47 at the beginnig, it will increase to 0.49.

# Discussion and Recomendations

+ Contrary to our main hypothesis, **NRD shows a significant and negative association with income inequality**.  

--

+ This **result is robust** to the type of analysis (cross-sectional vs panel data), the approach (spatial vs nonspatial) and the inclusion of different controls.

--

+ Implication: **The downward trend in the
participation of the primary sector in terms of employment in the Chilean economy could be one of the reasons explaining the high persistence in the levels of income inequality**.

--

+ **Policies** oriented to transform the structure of local economies to less dependent ones on natural resources will generate additional challenges for local and central governments in their attemps to reduce inequality  

--

+ **Education and municipal expenditure** seem to be **effective** policy tools aiming **to reduce inequality in Chile**.

# Limitations and Future Research

### Limitations
+ Data availability at the county level
+ Results do not allow us to make causal inferences about the effect of NRD on income inequality
+ Results are sensitive to the specification of the spatial weights

--

### Future Research
+ "Innovative" ways to define "distance" and W.
+ Incorporate measures of commuting and migration between counties.
+ Using measures of NRD as instrument for income inequality in studies about its consequences.

???
Why (how) can inequality influence LGE?:
- General reasons argued for most of the contextual factors are:
  + It influences competition among municipalities
  + It affects degree of monitoring over local authorities
  + It affects degree of incentives to perform efficiently (Paradox of Plenty, RCH)
  + Existence of economies or diseconomies of scale in the provision of public services

- Additionally for the case of inequality:
  + It is used to capture the degree of heterogeneity in the demands that county population exerts over local authorities
  + Small richest groups can exert a higher influence over local authorities (priorities) resulting in low quality and quantity of services for most of the county population.
  + Lower inequality with high mean income should be associated with a higher monitoring and demand for an efficient performance from tax payers (not only "the richest group").

+ **DEA**

--

  + The **"production function"** of municipalities **shows variable returns to scale**.

--

  + The **average level of inefficiency is 17%**, with higher levels in the South area of the country.

--

  + Efficiency shows a **ciclical behaviour** and, on average, has remained stable in the period 2006 - 2017.

--

+ **Regression analysis**

--

  + Empirical **evidence of a negative relationship between inequality and efficiency**.

--

  + A **reduction of income inequality** (or an increase in equality) **could have positive effects on economic efficiency**, at least at the **level of local governments**.
  
--

  + Negative association with **Education**.

--

### Future research

--

- How to capture **quality** in the provision of public services

--

- Is the negative coefficient for _education_ explained by  the reduction in **electoral participation**? 

--

- Modelling **spatial dependence-heterogeneity in LGE**. **Predictive analytics** (Machine Learning?) for the probability to get an eficient performance.

--

- Given the current situation: What about the issue of **reverse causality?**

Probability not only about getting a technical efficient performance but also an scale efficient specifically.

interpretation: In the model without IV, the coefficient is around 0.2. This means that, if inequality fall in 5 points, efficiency should increase in only 1 point. But in the model with IV, the coefficient is around 1, so 5 less point in gini should be associated with and increase in efficiency in 5 (or more points). We are talking about long-term changes!

# Does economic disadvantage <br>diminish social cohesion? <br>A study of the relationship between incivilities and income inequality at the municipal level in Chile

---
# What are "Incivilities"? 

--

>Incivilities are those visible disorders in the public space that violate respectful social norms and tend not to be treated as crimes by the criminal justice system

--

There two types of incivilities:
+ **Social incivilities** include antisocial behaviours such as public drinking, noisy neighbours, fighting in public places and street drug sales. 
--

+ **Physical incivilities** include, among others, vandalism, graffiti, abandoned cars and garbage on the streets.

--
# What is the problem?
#### Broken Window Theory

> Higher rates of incivilities are a signal of social disorganization
which result in higher crime rates (Wilson & Kelling, 1982)

# Research so far

>The negative impact of incivilities is not merely reflected in its **association with crime rates** (Skogan, 2015)

--

Incivilities have been associated with:
+ **Health problems** (Branas et al., 2011; Cohenet al., 2000; Hill & Angel, 2005; Ross, 2011; Ross & Mirowsky, 2001)

--

+ **Greater victimization** and **fear of crime** (Brunton-Smith, Jackson, & Sutherland, 2014; Mijanovich & Weitzman, 2003)

--

+ Multiple negative **economic effects**:
  + Reduction in commercial activity, lower investment in real estate and reduction in house prices (Skogan, 2015)
  + Population instability (Hipp, 2010).

#### The "Incivilities Thesis"

>Incivilities are caused by inequality and the lack of informal mechanisms of social control. **The patterns of incivilities should mirror the patterns of inequality** (Taylor, 1999)

--

#### Chilean evidence: 
+ Focussed on crime and showing weak and ambiguous results

--

  + **Indicators of socio-economic disadvantage** would only have significant effects on property crime (Beyer & Vergara, 2006; Nuñez, Rivera, Villavicencio, & Molina, 2003; Rivera, Gutiérrez, & Núñez,2009). 

--

  + **Crime deterrence variables**: The probability of being caught or the number of police resources (Beyer & Vergara, 2006; Rivera et al., 2009; Vergara, 2012).

???
In Chile there is no evidence about causes of incivilities, but the BRoken Windows Theory has been used to argue new punitive actions to reduce crime, victimization and the feeling of insecutity in the population

???
In general, the relationship (effect) with incivilities depend on whether the variable is associated with a higher (lower) reported rate and/or whether it associated with a higher "probability to commit negligent or antisocial behaviour" (reduction in informal control) 
---

# Data

+ Data on the number of **incivilities** were obtained from the **“Centre of Studies and Analysis of Crime”** (Chilean government) 

--

+ Dependent variable:

--

\begin{equation}
inciv\_rate=\frac{incivilities_{it}}{n_{it}}*1000;
\end{equation}

--

  + Where $inciv\_rate$ is the incivilities rate, $t$ is the year, $i$ the county and $n$ is the population of the county per year.

--

+ Independent variable:

--

  + The **Gini coefficient** is calculated for each county
and included through the variable _gini_.

# Method: Panel Count Data models

+ Considering as the response variable the count of incivilities:

--

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{it} =exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1gini_{it} + X\gamma+\alpha_i +\theta_t)
\end{equation}

--

+ where
  + $\lambda$ is the rate of incivilities, 
  + $X$ is our vector of controls, 
  + $\alpha's$ are county-specific constants and 
  + $\theta's$ are time-specific constants. 

--

+ To account for differences in county population, we have:

--

\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda_{it}}{(\frac{population_{it}}{1000})} =exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1gini_{it} + X\gamma+\alpha_i +\theta_t)
\end{equation}

--

+ The model estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is:

--

\begin{equation}
log(\lambda_{it}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1gini_{it} + X\gamma+\alpha_i +\theta_t+log(\frac{population_{it}}{1000})
\end{equation}

# Discussion and Recomendations

+ We found strong evidence of a **significant and positive association between the rate of incivilities and income inequality**. 

--

+ Policies aimed at controlling the behaviour of **young people** do not have strong empirical support. 

+ The significant increase in the **foreign population** seems to be associated with a significant increase in the problem of incivilities. 

--

+ Efforts managed from the **municipalities** can be an important complement to those from the central government.

# Conclusions and Future Research

+ **Increasing income inequality** or persistently high levels might be associated with the **rise of antisocial behaviours** in the form of incivilities. 

--

+ Future research should go further on the **role of local authorities** analysing the impact of specific programs in counties with similar characteristics.

--

+ **Program evaluation** could help to elucidate the question of whether local interventions from the local governments have a causal effect on incivilities and crime rates. 

--

+ A deeper analysis of the **impact that foreign migration is having on social cohesion in the Chilean society** is an interesting avenue for future studies

### Interpreting coefficients Poisson (NB) Regression:

.left[
The coefficient for the variable gini in the FE Poisson model es 0.022. This means that:


+ An increase in one unit in the Gini coefficient increases the log of count per 1000 inhabitants in 0.022.


+ An increase in one unit in the Gini coefficient increases
the rate of incivilities per 1000 inhabitants in $e^{0.022}=1.022$ times.  

For the case of categorial variables, for instance, the variable mayorLEFT, the coefficient 0.048 for the Negative Binomial results means that:

+ The incivilities rate per 1000 inhabitants in municipalities managed by "LEFT" political supported mayors is nearly 1.049 $(e^{0.048})$ times that of municipalities managed by INDEPENDENT mayors (given de other of controls).
