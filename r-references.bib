abstract = {We examine how in-kind transfers provided by local governments affect economic inequality. The allocation of in-kind transfers to households and the adjustment for differences in needs are derived from a model of local government spending behavior. The model distinguishes between fixed and variable costs in production as well as mandatory programmatic spending components versus discretionary spending on different service sectors and target groups. To estimate the model, we combine Norwegian data from municipal accounts and administrative registers for the period 1982–2013. We find that economic inequality is considerably lower when taking in-kind transfers into account. While the poor benefit from receiving a relatively large share of public services, the equalizing effect of in-kind transfers tends to be smaller than the equalizing contribution from public cash transfers. When examining the time trends in inequality, we find that local governments attenuated the growth in cash income inequality by re-allocating in-kind transfers to low-income families. This reduction in inequality is mostly due to changes in spending priorities across service sectors and target groups, while the contribution from re-allocation of resources across municipalities is much smaller.},

abstract = {In the extant literature, very few studies have simultaneously examined the impact of individual attributes, neighbourhood disorder and social cohesion on an individual's fear of crime. This article addresses the use of multiple-indicator, multiple-cause (MIMIC) analysis for testing different variables related to the fear of crime based on a number of theories. Face-to-face interviews with residents of a high-crime council estate were conducted to examine the crime rate, disorder, cohesion and the fear of crime in the participants' residential area. The results support the incivilities thesis and the vulnerability hypothesis, while the social disorganisation theory was partially supported. It was concluded that women and the elderly demonstrate higher levels of fear than men and the nonelderly and that crime, disorder and social cohesion have a direct effect on one's level of fear, as the decreases in neighbourhood cohesion increase the individuals' levels of fear. In addition, people who have been victimised and those who perceive higher levels of incivility were found to be more fearful of crime. By incorporating the three theories, the final model is able to account for 50 {\%} of the variance in the fear of crime.},

abstract = {This book examines the paradox that resource-rich countries often struggle to manage their resources in a way that will help their economies thrive. It looks at how a country's political regime and quality of governance can determine the degree to which it benefits - or suffers - from having natural resources, shifting away from the traditional focus on economic growth data to study the complex implications of these resources for human well-being and sustainable development. To this end, Acar examines a panel of countries in terms of the effects of their natural resources on human development and genuine saving, which is a sustainability indicator that takes into account the welfare of future generations by incorporating the changes in different kinds of capital. Acar finds that the exportation of agricultural raw materials is associated with significant deterioration in human development, while extractive resource exports, such as energy and minerals, have negative implications for genuine savings. Next, the book compares the development path of Norway before and after discovering oil, contrasting it with Sweden's development. The two countries, which followed almost identical paths until the 1970s, diverged significantly in terms of per capita income after Norway found oil.},

This essay discusses the link between technical change and the labor market with special emphasis on the recent changes in the US wage structure. The behavior of wages and returns to schooling in the US indicates that technical change has been skill-biased during the past 60 years, and possibly for most of the twentieth century. The evidence points to an acceleration in skill bias during the past few decades. When developing skill-biased techniques is more profitable, new technology will tend to be skill-biased. The twentieth century has been characterized by skill-biased technical change because the rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers has induced the development of skill-complementary technologies.;This essay discusses the effect of technical change on wage inequality. I argue that the behavior of wages and returns to schooling indicates that technical change has been skill-biased during the past sixty years. Furthermore, the recent increase in inequality is most likely due to an acceleration in skill bias. In contrast to twentieth-century developments, much of the technical change during the early nineteenth century appears to be skill-replacing. I suggest that this is because the increased supply of unskilled workers in the English cities made the introduction of these technologies profitable. On the other hand, the twentieth century has been characterized by skill-biased technical change because the rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers has induced the development of skill-complementary technologies. The recent acceleration in skill bias is in turn likely to have been a response to the acceleration in the supply of skills during the past several decades.;This essay discusses the effect of technical change on wage inequality.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite tremendous efforts to scale up key maternal and child health interventions in Zambia, progress has not been uniform across the country. This raises fundamental health system performance questions that require further investigation. Our study investigates technical and scale efficiency (SE) in the delivery of maternal and child health services in the country. SETTING: The study focused on all 72 health districts of Zambia. METHODS: We compiled a district-level database comprising health outcomes (measured by the probability of survival to 5 years of age), health outputs (measured by coverage of key health interventions) and a set of health system inputs, namely, financial resources and human resources for health, for the year 2010. We used data envelopment analysis to assess the performance of subnational units across Zambia with respect to technical and SE, controlling for environmental factors that are beyond the control of health system decision makers. RESULTS: Nationally, average technical efficiency with respect to improving child survival was 61.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 58.2{\%} to 64.8{\%}), which suggests that there is a huge inefficiency in resource use in the country and the potential to expand services without injecting additional resources into the system. Districts that were more urbanised and had a higher proportion of educated women were more technically efficient. Improved cooking methods and donor funding had no significant effect on efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: With the pressing need to accelerate progress in population health, decision makers must seek efficient ways to deliver services to achieve universal health coverage. Understanding the factors that drive performance and seeking ways to enhance efficiency offer a practical pathway through which low-income countries could improve population health without necessarily seeking additional resources. },

(Public Choice, 123(3--4):321--47, 2005), to look at the public expenditure of 20 OECD countries for the period 2009--2013, from an efficiency perspective. We construct Public Sector Performance and Public Sector Efficiency indicators and use Data Envelopment Analysis. The results show that the only country that performed on the efficiency frontier is Switzerland, Canada, Japan, Luxembourg and the United States are also more efficient performers. The average input-oriented efficiency score is equal to 0.732. That is, on average countries could have reduced the level of public expenditure by 26.8{\%} and still achieved the same level of public performance. The average output-oriented efficiency score is 0.769 denoting that on average the sample countries could have increased their performance by 23.1{\%} by employing the same level of public expenditure.},

abstract = {Abstract Despite success in poverty reduction, inequality in Chile has remained virtually unchanged over the last 20 years. High levels of inequality have been shown to hamper further reductions in poverty as well as economic growth, and local inequality has been shown to affect such outcomes as violence and health. The study of inequality at the local level is thus crucial for understanding the economic wellbeing of a country. Local measures of inequality have been difficult to obtain, but recent theoretical advances have enabled the combination of survey and census data to generate estimates of inequality that are robust at disaggregated geographic levels. We employ this methodology to produce consistent and precise estimates of inequality for every county in Chile. We find considerable heterogeneity in county-level estimates of inequality, with Gini coefficients ranging from 0.41 to 0.64.},

abstract = {  The objective of this paper is to present an inequality decomposition method, the two-stage nested Theil decomposition method, which is an extension of the ordinary one-stage Theil decomposition method. The method is analogous to a two-stage nested design in the analysis of variance (ANOVA). It considers the three-level hierarchical structure of a country: region-province-district, and decomposes overall regional inequality, as measured by Theil indices based on district-level mean incomes, into three components: the between-region, between-province, and within-province inequality components. The within-province component is a weighted-average of within-province income inequalities for each province, while the between-province component is a weighted-average of between-province income inequalities within each region. The method uses a district as the underlying regional unit to measure regional income inequality, rather than a province, and thus can analyze the contribution of within-province inequalities as well as between-province and between-region inequalities to the overall regional income inequality in a coherent framework.

abstract = {Does natural resource production benefit producer economies, or does it instead create a "Natural Resource Curse," perhaps as Dutch Disease crowds out the manufacturing sector? We combine a new panel dataset of oil and gas production and reserves with county-level aggregate outcomes and restricted-access Census of Manufactures microdata to estimate how oil and gas booms have affected local economic growth in the U.S. since the 1960s. We find that a boom that doubles national oil and gas employment increases total employment by 2.9 percent in a county with one standard deviation larger oil and gas endowment. Despite substantial migration, wages also rise. Notwithstanding, manufacturing employment and output are actually pro-cyclical with oil and gas booms, because many manufacturers in resource-abundant counties supply inputs to the oil and gas sector, while many others sell locally-traded goods and benefit from increases in local demand. Manufacturers' revenue productivity also grows during booms, especially in linked and local industries, but there is no evidence that output prices rise. The results demonstrate how a meaningful share of manufacturers produce locally traded goods, and they highlight how linkages to natural resources can be a driver of manufacturing growth.},

abstract = {This study investigates technical efficiency and productivity for Swedish higher education institutions (HEIs). One identified problem in previous research concerns adjusting efficiency scores for input quality. This problem is avoided using grades from upper-secondary schools. A second problem concerns heterogeneity with respect to subjects and institutions between HEIs. Using the Swedish national resource allocation system, students are weighted according to subject. For research production, a bibliometric index that allows for differences in publication tradition is used. A third problem when using the data envelopment analysis approach is the lack of statistical inference. Bootstrapping is used to approach this problem. The results indicate an average inefficiency of 12{\%} and a productivity increase of around 1.7{\%} per year. },

abstract = {The capabilities for visualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic information systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the ''spatial'' aspects of the data. The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G(i)*; statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ''outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, focusing on the normative approach, we review and discuss the main multidimensional inequality measures and inequality-adjusted multidimensional well-being indicators. Using Italian data on individual income, education and health status from the 2005 and 2008 Italian Survey on Income and Living Conditions (IT-SILC), an empirical analysis of multidimensional inequality and inequality-adjusted well-being levels in Italian regions has been performed. Given the variability that characterizes inequality and well-being indicators, depending on the uncertainty connected to the survey nature of the data as well as on the alternative parameter combinations chosen, the regional indices are presented together with the corresponding confidence intervals, as an instrument for assessing the robustness of well-being rankings. A significant result of the analysis is that distributional concerns, both across individuals and between dimensions, remarkably affects discrepancies in regional well-being. More specifically, increasing inequality aversion and decreasing substitutability between attributes progressively widen regional well-being differences. The same pattern emerges from the analysis of the evolution of regional well-being over time, revealing that high growth rates are related with improvements in the equity of interpersonal well-being distribution and, especially, with a recovery in its worse-off dimensions. },

abstract = {electoralIntertemporal Competition reduces rent extraction in private-sector firms. In this article, we empirically assess whether it similarly disciplines politicians by evaluating local-level governments' performance in Flanders. The results indicate that electoral competition – measured via the number of parties competing in elections – significantly positively affects the productive efficiency of municipal policy. Intertemporal competition – measured as the volatility of election outcomes over time – has a similar, but weaker, positive effect. These beneficial effects are mitigated by the fact that competition may lead to more fragmented governments, which is shown to work against their productive efficiency. Overall, though, the beneficial effects outweigh the unfavourable ones in our sample. },

abstract = {Over the last decades spatial econometric models have represented a common tool for measuring spillover effects across different geographical entities (counties, provinces, regions or nations). The aim of this paper is to investigate the issue of measuring spatial spillovers in the presence of institutional constraints that can be geographically defined. In these cases, assuming that spatial effects are not affected by the institutional setting may produce biased estimates due to the composition of twodistinct sources of spatial dependence. Our approach is based on redefining the contiguity structure so as to account for the institutional constraints using two different contiguity matrices: the within matrix, which defines contiguity among units obeying the same institutional setting, and the between matrix, which traces spatial linkages among contiguous units across different jurisdictions. This approach allows to disentangle the two sources of spatial correlation and to easily test for the existence of binding institutional constraints. From the econometric perspective, we extend Lacombe (2004) approach to incorporate the aforementioned institutional constraints in a spatial Durbin model with individual specific slopes, while inference is conducted using a two-way cluster robust variance–covariance matrix controlling for both spatial and time correlations. We apply this methodology to analyze spatial dependence of per-capita public health expenditures in Italyat Local Health Authority level using a balanced panel dataset from 2001 to 2005. Our results show robust evidence of a significant and positive spatial coefficient for the within effect, while the between effect, although significant, is very close to zero, thus confirming the importance and validity of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {  Distributional changes are an important part of the economic history of the OECD countries over the twentieth century. In the UK, income inequality in the 1970s was substantially lower than 40 years earlier, and is now much higher than in 1979. The pattern of change in the USA has similarities to that in the UK, but other countries have exhibited significant differences. In order to explain diversity of experience over time, and differences in income inequality across countries today, we need to recognize that the distribution of income is subject to a variety of forces, affecting earnings, wealth, and income. These forces include the policy choices made by governments affecting market incomes and fiscal redistribution. What we need to explain is why in some periods a number of these forces combine to produce episodes of rising, or falling, inequality. Any single theory, such as that based on a global shift of demand away from unskilled workers, cannot provide a fully adequate explanation.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the natural resource curse. We review the mechanisms through which resource wealth might slow economic growth, and the empirical studies that test for an effect overall, or on factors associated with growth. We include more recent studies suggesting the resource curse reflects only empirical misspecification. After reflecting on this conflicting evidence, and the findings of other recent surveys, we argue the evidence that resource dependence negatively affects growth remains convincing, particularly working through factors closely associated with growth in developing countries. Recent contrarian studies demonstrate that future research should better address endogeneity of dependence measures, and expand the years of study and range of empirical methodologies used.},

abstract = {This article analyzes the efficiency of local governments in the Comunitat Valenciana (Spain) and their main explanatory variables. The analysis is performed in two stages. Firstly, efficiency is measured via (nonparametric) activity analysis techniques. Specifically, we consider both Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Free Disposable Hull (FDH) techniques. The second stage identifies some critical determinants of efficiency, focusing on both political and fiscal policy variables. In contrast to previous two-stage research studies, our approach performs the latter attempt via nonparametric smoothing techniques, rather than econometric methods such as OLS or Tobit related techniques. Results show that efficiency scores, especially under the nonconvexity assumption (FDH), are higher for large municipalities. Thus, there is empirical evidence to suggest that resources may be better allocated by large municipalities. However, the inefficiency found is not entirely attributable to poor management, as second-stage analysis reveals both fiscal and political variables to be explicably related to municipality performance. Moreover, the explanatory variables' impact on efficiency is robust to the chosen technique—either convex DEA or nonconvex FDH. },

In particular, the paper studies the non-stationarity and cointegration properties between health care spending and income. This is done in a panel data context controlling for both cross-section dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. Cross-section dependence is modelled through a common factor model and through spatial dependence. Heterogeneity is handled through fixed effects in a panel homogeneous model and through a panel heterogeneous model. Our findings suggest that health care is a necessity rather than a luxury, with an elasticity much smaller than that estimated in previous studies. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}AbstractThis paper provides, for the first time, an insight into the influence of urban, political, demographic, and economic factors on several categories of municipal spending, after controlling for the spatial effects. The models of spatial two-step least squares (S2SLS), spatial lag, and spatial error are applied to a sample of 3,204 Spanish municipalities for the year 2005. The results show that the spending of a municipality is influenced by its neighboring municipalities' spending. Concerning geographical factors, population density has a negative impact on municipal expenditures per capita. The negative impact of population density on per capita total expenditures has policy relevance because it indicates that planning decisions aiming at increase population density will reduce per capita government expenditures, both in small and larger cities. Political ideology does not influence spending. Nevertheless, strong political governments do spend more. Therefore, it is not that the incumbents belong to left or right, but their strong majority which allows them to carry out their policies by spending more. The policy issue at stake here is whether municipal political majorities should be tempered, so that opposition surveillance keeps spending under control.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Cet article met l'accent sur l'importance de tenir compte de l'heterogeneite regionale dans l'analyse dynamique des ecarts regionaux economiques. En regle generale, les etudes sur la croissance regionale laissent supposer que la structure socio-demographique des regions est homogene. On cherche ici a affirmer que l'analyse de la convergence regionale doit etre tester sous condition, telle la structure socio-demographique des travailleurs dans les diverses regions. Dans ce but, on estime plusieurs mesures de l'ecart des salaires regionaux sous condition a partir des donnees israeliennes pour la periode de 1991 a 2002. Les resultats laissent voir que la moitie de l'ecart des salaires regionaux environ s'explique par les conditions posees. Poser des conditions influe sensiblement sur les estimations de convergence Gini et beta. Les mobilites beta et Gini sous condition se chiffrent a environ la moitie de leurs equivalents sans condition.

In diesem Beitrag wird die Bedeutung einer Berucksichtigung der regionalen Heterogenitat bei einer dynamischen Analyse der regionalen wirtschaftlichen Disparitaten betont. In den meisten Studien zum Regionalwachstum wird davon ausgegangen, dass Regionen hinsichtlich ihrer soziodemografischen Zusammensetzung homogen sind. Wir argumentieren, dass die Analyse der regionalen Konvergenz konditional uberpruft werden muss, d.h. in Abhangigkeit von der soziodemografischen Struktur der Arbeitnehmer in den verschiedenen Regionen. Zu diesem Zweck schatzen wir die verschiedenen Massstabe fur die konditionalen regionalen Einkommensunterschiede mit Hilfe von Regionaldaten aus Israel fur den Zeitraum von 1991 bis 2002. Aus unseren Ergebnissen geht hervor, dass sich etwa die Halfte der regionalen Einkommensunterschiede auf die konditionierenden Variablen zuruckfuhren lasst. Die Konditionierung macht auch bei den Schatzungen des Gini-Koeffizienten und der Beta-Konvergen einen erheblichen Unterschied. Die konditionale Beta- und Gini-Mobilitat betragt etwa die Halfte ihrer nicht konditionalen Vergleichswerte.

Sostenemos que debe comprobarse condicionalmente el analisis de la convergencia regional, es decir, condicional en la estructura sociodemografica de los trabajadores en las diferentes regiones. Con este fin calculamos las diferentes medidas de las desigualdades salariales condicionales en las regiones usando datos regionales de Israel durante el periodo de 1991 a 2002. Nuestros resultados indican que aproximadamente la mitad de las desigualdades salariales regionales se deben a variables condicionales.

Regionale Heterogenit{\"{a}}t, konditionale Konvergenz und regionale Unterschiede, Regional Studies. In diesem Beitrag wird die Bedeutung einer Ber{\"{u}}cksichtigung der regionalen Heterogenit{\"{a}}t bei einer dynamischen Analyse der regionalen wirtschaftlichen Disparit{\"{a}}ten betont. In den meisten Studien zum Regionalwachstum wird davon ausgegangen, dass Regionen hinsichtlich ihrer soziodemografischen Zusammensetzung homogen sind. Wir argumentieren, dass die Analy e der regionalen Konvergenz konditional {\"{u}}berpr{\"{u}}ft werden muss, d.h. in Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeit von der soziodemografischen Struktur der Arbeitnehmer in den verschiedenen Regionen. Zu diesem Zweck sch{\"{a}}tzen wir die verschiedenen Ma{\ss}st{\"{a}}be f{\"{u}}r die konditionalen regionalen Einkommensunterschiede mit Hilfe von Regionaldaten aus Israel f{\"{u}}r den Zeitraum von 1991 bis 2002. Aus unseren Ergebnissen geht hervor, dass sich etwa die H{\"{a}}lfte der regionalen Einkommensunterschiede auf die konditionierenden Variablen zur{\"{u}}ckf{\"{u}}hren l{\"{a}}sst. Die Konditionierung macht auch bei den Sch{\"{a}}tzungen des Gini-Koeffizienten und der Beta-Konvergenz einen erheblichen Unterschied.

Services analysed are: police, culture, sports, green areas, refuse collection and water supply. Ratios of efficiency have been related to other control variables, such as economic level, size of the municipality, decentralization, political sign and financial situation. A weak positive relation between economic level and efficiency arises. Some weak evidence also exists that public management of refuse collection is more efficient than private. In water supply, public management by means of a company controlled by the local government is clearly more efficient than private. It also seems that the higher the tax burden, the greater the efficiency in providing services. },

A claim is often made in criminology applications that the negative binomial distribution is the conditional distribution of choice when for a count response variable there is evidence of overdispersion. Some go on to assert that the overdisperson problem can be “solved” when the negative binomial distribution is used instead of the more conventional Poisson distribution. In this paper, we review the assumptions required for both distributions and show that only under very special circumstances are these claims true. },

abstract = {This book brings together a range of ideas and theories to arrive at a deeper understanding of inequality in Latin America and its complex realities. To so, it addresses questions such as: What are the origins of inequality in Latin America? How can we create societies that are more equal in terms of income distribution, gender equality and opportunities? How can we remedy the social divide that is making Latin America one of the most unequal regions on earth? What are the roles played by market forces, institutions and ideology in terms of inequality?In this book, a group of global experts gathered by the Institute for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean (INTAL), part of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), show readers how various types of inequality, such as economical, educational, racial and gender inequality have been practiced in countries like Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico and many others through the centuries.Presenting new ideas, new evidence, and new methods, the book subsequently analyzes how to move forward with second-generation reforms that lay the foundations for more egalitarian societies. As such, it offers a valuable and insightful guide for development economists, historians and Latin American specialists alike, as well as students, educators, policymakers and all citizens with an interest in development, inequality and the Latin American region.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The paper briefly reviews the main theories formulated over time on the economic effects of public indebtedness, with the aim to highlight their common and divergent points, the arguments they rely upon, as well as their relevance, given the current economic environment. Three major views are considered, namely the classical one, the Keynesian one and the view of neoliberal economists (monetarist economists and representatives of the school of rational expectations). The comparative approach of the different views allowed us to shape some criteria of decision which may prove useful for public policymakers in formulating public debt policies conducive to economic growth: public indebtedness should not become common practice but be reserved for those situations in which the economy is confronted with unusual phenomena, such as economic downturns; borrowed resources should be used especially on those destinations which create added value in the economy, such as public investment; public debt should not accumulate at a fast pace and should be kept within reasonable limits, to avoid possible side effects on economic growth.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The paper aims to empirically assess, using panel data estimation techniques, the effects of public indebtedness on economic growth for a group of 11 Central and Eastern European countries and over the period 1994-2013. Our hypothesis is that, although public indebtedness may fuel economic growth, once public debt breaches a certain threshold the effects are reversed and public indebtedness negatively affects GDP growth rates. The results of our study confirm this kind of relationship, with a maximum debt threshold for all countries of about 45-55{\%} of GDP, lower for the less developed (like Romania and Bulgaria) and higher for the more developed ones. Also, the threshold for Central and Eastern European countries is found to be lower than the one identified in other empirical studies for developed EU countries, as the former enjoy lower credibility, higher vulnerability to shocks and depend more on external capital transfers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

abstract = {Crime prevention strategists have long been examining the impact of land use on crime, particularly the effects of non-residential land use in the form of facilities. Places like bars, motels, schools, convenience stores, and check-cashing centers have been examined in relation to crime to the point that it seems we now have a “criminology of the unpopular” (Wilcox and Eck in Criminol Public Policy 10(2):473–482, 2011), whereby places of a particular type are assumed to inherently offer crime opportunity. However, other theoretical and empirical work suggests that facility type may not matter and that specific characteristics and contexts associated with crime opportunity at places should be measured as opposed to assuming that broad categories of land uses typically generate crime (e.g., Brantingham and Brantingham in Stud Crime Crime Prev 8(1):7–26, 1999; Eck et al. in Crime Prev Stud 21:225, 2007; Hart and Miethe in Secur J 27(2):180–193, 2014; Smith et al. in Criminology 38(2):489–524, 2000; Wilcox and Eck in Criminol Public Policy 10(2):473–482, 2011). As an exploratory test of this latter idea, the present study uses observational data collected repeatedly at a small number of places over a one-year period—including land-use types that are not typically associated with crime (i.e., gardens)—in order to examine whether land-use parcels of the same type but with differing criminal opportunities have differing levels of crime.},

Negative binomial regression models are estimated to explain the relationship between the increase in average home values (a component of gentrification) and crime in Los Angeles between 1990 and 2000. We find that the spatial context is important, as gentrifying neighborhoods located on the “frontier” of the gentrification process have significantly more aggravated assaults than gentrifying neighborhoods surrounded by neighborhoods also undergoing improvement. Furthermore, this effect is stronger in neighborhoods that began the decade with the highest average home values. Our findings indicate that the extent to which neighborhoods are more or less embedded in a larger process of economic improvement, and where the neighborhood is at in the economic development process, has differential effects on neighborhood crime. },

In order to address this issue we take advantage of a new global efficiency measure for Norwegian local governments.

In addition there is some evidence that democratic participation increases efficiency, while a centralized top-down budgetary procedure is associated with low efficiency. },

abstract = {A better understanding of the determinants of public health care expenditures is key to designing effective health policies. We integrate demand and supply-side determinants and factors from political economy into an empirical analysis of the highly decentralized Swiss health care system and control for major health care finance reforms. We compile a novel data set of the cantonal health care expenditure in Switzerland, which currently amounts to about one fifth of total health care expenditure. We analyze the period 1970–2012 and use dynamic panel estimation methods. We find that per capita income, the unemployment rate and the share of foreigners are positively related to public health care expenditure growth. With regard to political economy aspects, public health care expenditures increase with the share of women elected to parliament. However, institutional restrictions for politicians, such as fiscal rules, do not appear to limit public health care expenditure growth.},

abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between government fines and neighborhood composition using data on parking citations in Los Angeles. Parking ticket fines have received significant attention in public debates concerning bias in government and law enforcement practices. In these debates, community advocates claim that parking citations are spatially concentrated in neighborhoods of predominantly economically vulnerable populations. Using parking ticket data in 2016 from the City of Los Angeles, this study shows that the number of parking tickets is higher in neighborhoods with a larger presence of renters, young adults, and Black residents. The study also finds that the burden on Black neighborhoods is not alleviated by Black representation in city council. However, Hispanic neighborhoods with a Hispanic council representative experienced higher parking ticket rates for regulations that are more likely to be violated by visitors, specifically, violations occurring during the evening and overnight hours, and specific to time-limit and permit-related regulations.},

abstract = {The popular incivilities hypothesis suggests physical incivilities, such as unkempt lawns and litter, and weak social ties with neighbors encourage crime. Despite a strong impact on policing policies and public awareness, this hypothesis has seldom been tested. We extend this basic model to test whether place attachments protect from crime as well. In a suburban area facing decline, multilevel (hierarchical linear modeling) analyses reveal that renters, properties with more physical incivilities, and blocks with more physical incivilities experience more subsequent crimes. Although these actual physical incivilities were important predictors of crime, residents' perceptions of incivilities were not, suggesting that environmental incivilities act directly upon offenders, not through non-offender resident perceptions. A cross-level interaction indicated incivilities predicted crime less well on socially cohesive blocks, suggesting that social cohesion can buffer the effects of the physical environment. Weaker block level place attachments also contributed independently to individuals' risks of crime, demonstrating that place attachment merits greater attention in neighborhood revitalization and crime reduction interventions.},

abstract = {This paper uses a 1976 microdata base to estimate the marginal cost of reducing income inequality with a policy that has distributional effects similar to the present tax-transfer system. The analysis uses a simulation methodology in which only the labor supply effects are evaluated; other behavioral effects are ignored. The most striking finding is that marginal cost is quite high even for modest labor supply elasticities. For example, in the benchmark case with a weighted-average economy-wide uncompensated wage elasticity of 0.2 (and compensated elasticity of 0.31), the disposable money income of upper-income quintiles of households is depressed by 9.51 for each dollar increase in the disposable money income of lower-income quintiles. When income equivalent values that take account of the value of leisure are compared, the marginal cost for this case is estimated to be 3.49.},

Consistent with the existing literature on the relationship between resource abundance and economic growth we find that, given an initial income level, resource-intensive countries tend to suffer lower levels of human development.

abstract = {Starting from Becker's seminal paper we review the first contributions to the economics of crime, stressing how with the first model of criminal choice, due to Becker, the way of conceiving criminal behaviours has drastically changed. In fact, criminal choice ceases to be viewed as determined by mental illness or bad attitudes, but it is considered on the basis of a maximization problem in which agents have to compare costs and benefits of legal and illegal activities taking in account the probability of being arrested and punished and the expected returns from crime. Criminal decision is an economic choice by rational agents. In the second part of the survey, in which we focus our attention on empirical works, we present the main recent contributions to the economics of crime; in particular we outline the determinants of criminal behaviours and explore the relationships existing between crime and socioeconomic variables emerging from the literature. In fact, the economics of crime interacts with different and heterogeneous fields (i.e. sociology, criminology, psychiatry and geography). It is closely related to poverty, social exclusion, wage and income inequality, cultural and family background, level of education and other economic and social factors that may affect individual's propensity to commit crimes such as cultural characteristics, age and sex.},

Amalgamation programmes in all six states resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of local authorities in Australia. The chief rationale underlying local government mergers lay apparently in the belief that larger municipalities would exhibit greater economic efficiencies. Despite its widespread acceptance amongst policy elites, this argument did not derive from a solid empirical base.

The estimation of a system of equations provides support to both hypotheses. In addition, results suggest that resource abundance might also affect human development by reducing the quality of institutions. However, while statistically significant, this effect is quantitatively small. Finally, there is evidence of a strong, negative direct effect of resource abundance on human development after controlling for inequality, institutional quality, and the level of per-capita income.

Following a discussion of theories and empirical evidence regarding regional income adjustment, the regional dispersion of per capita income is analysed for the six Australian states and at the sub-state level (statistical divisions, SDs). The coefficient of variation is used as the measure of dispersion, and Gini coefficients are also calculated to analyze income equality within regions. For Australia, the cross-state dispersion of per capita incomes increased over the period, whereas there was neither convergence nor divergence of incomes among Australia's 57 SDs. in addition, the intrastate dispersion of per capita incomes across SDs remained largely unaltered over the period. Gini coefficients indicated that across income strata, the distribution of incomes both within states and within SDs has become more equal.},

As such, it seems pertinent to analyse their impact on economic growth considering both phenomena together. By estimating a dynamic panel specification at country level, this paper analyses how agglomeration and inequality (both their levels and their evolution) influence long-run economic growth. In line with previous findings, our results suggest that while high-inequality levels are a limiting factor for long-run growth, agglomeration processes can be associated with economic growth, at least in countries at early stages of development. Moreover, we find that the growth-enhancing benefits from agglomeration processes depend not only on the country's level of development, but also on its initial income distribution (something, to the best of our knowledge, not considered before). In fact, probably suggesting a social dimension to congestion diseconomies, increasing agglomeration is associated with lower growth when income distribution is particularly unequal.;Agglomeration and income inequality at country level can be both understood as concentration of physical and human capital in the process of economic development.

First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4{\%} in Charlotte but 12.9{\%} in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability.

abstract = {We present new evidence on trends in intergenerational mobility in the United States using administrative earnings records. We find that percentile rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility have remained extremely stable for the 1971-1993 birth cohorts. For children born between 1971 and 1986, we measure intergenerational mobility based on the correlation between parent and child income percentile ranks. For more recent cohorts, we measure mobility as the correlation between a child's probability of attending college and her parents' income rank. We also calculate transition probabilities, such as a child's chances of reaching the top quintile of the income distribution starting from the bottom quintile. Based on all of these measures, we find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s. However, because inequality has risen, the consequences of the "birth lottery"--the parents to whom a child is born--are larger today than in the past.;  We present new evidence on trends in intergenerational mobility in the United States using administrative earnings records.

abstract = {This article studies the joint effect of political and economic inequalities on redistributive taxation and institutional quality. The theoretical model suggests that income inequality, coupled with political bias in favor of the rich, decreases redistribution and lowers institutional quality. The effect of the former is to increase productive investment, and the effect of the latter is to decrease it--with resulting ambiguous implications for economic growth. Testing these predictions empirically in a panel of countries, we find that inequality has a negative effect on both institutional quality and redistribution.},

Today, the richest 10 per cent of the population in the OECD area earn 9.5 times the income of the poorest 10 per cent; in the 1980s this ratio stood at 7:1 and has been rising continuously ever since. However, the rise in overall income inequality is not (only) about surging top income shares: often, incomes at the bottom grew much slower during the prosperous years and fell during downturns, putting relative (and in some countries, absolute) income poverty on the radar of policy concerns. This paper explores whether such developments may have an impact on economic performance. Drawing on harmonised data covering the OECD countries over the past 30 years, the econometric analysis suggests that income inequality has a negative and statistically significant impact on subsequent growth. In particular, what matters most is the gap between low income households and the rest of the population. In contrast, no evidence is found that those with high incomes pulling away from the rest of the population harms growth. The paper also evaluates the “human capital accumulation theory” finding evidence for human capital as a channel through which inequality may affect growth. Analysis based on micro data from the Adult Skills Survey (PIAAC) shows that increased income disparities depress skills development among individuals with poorer parental education background, both in terms of the quantity of education attained (e.g. years of schooling), and in terms of its quality (i.e. skill proficiency). Educational outcomes of individuals from richer backgrounds, however, are not affected by inequality. It follows that policies to reduce income inequalities should not only be pursued to improve social outcomes but also to sustain long-term growth. Redistribution policies via taxes and transfers are a key tool to ensure the benefits of growth are more broadly distributed and the results suggest they need not be expected to undermine growth. But it is also important to promote equality of opportunity in access to and quality of education. This implies a focus on families with children and youths – as this is when decisions about human capital accumulation are made -- promoting employment for disadvantaged groups through active labour market policies, childcare supports and in-work benefits.;In most OECD countries, the gap between rich and poor is at its highest level since 30 years.

abstract = {This paper has two goals. The first is to show that the heat hypothesis provides a partial explanation of violent crime in society. The second is to suggest an alternative hypothesis that intentional homicides can be explained by the level of income inequality, even when controlling thermal climate and other factors. The vast literature in these research fields has suggested several approaches to explain aggression and violent behavior in society, such as the heat hypothesis and the model of Climate, Aggression, and Self-control in Humans (CLASH). However, there are at least some factors about aggression and violent behavior that current theories have trouble explaining. This study proposes income inequality, latitude and their interaction as predictors of intentional homicides. Statistical evidence based on country-level analyses (N=191 countries) reveals that controlling thermal climate and other factors, socioeconomic inequality is positively associated with violent crime. In particular, the findings here seem in general to support the hypothesis that differences between countries in intentional homicides (per 100,000 people) can be explained by the level of income inequality alone, and not thermal climate as a second predictor or the interaction of income inequality and thermal climate. These results suggest that income inequality may overpower the role of hot weather and seasonal variation of temperature to explain the level of violent crime in human society. A prediction of this theory here is that societies with low socioeconomic inequality, independently of thermal climate, are not likely to produce high levels of intentional homicides and violent crime. This finding can be useful for bringing a new perspective to explain and generalize one of the determinants that generates violent crime in human society. Some policy implications are suggested to reduce these social issues.},

We use this comprehensive data set to uncover general patterns of technology diffusion. Our main 5 findings are as follows: (i) Once the intensive margin is measured, technologies do not diffuse in a logistic way. (ii) Within a typical technology, the dispersion in the adoption levels across countries is about 5 times larger than the cross-country dispersion in income per capita. (iii) The rankings of countries by level of technology adoption are very highly correlated across technologies. (iv) Within a typical technology, there has been convergence at an average rate of 4 percent per year. (v) The speed of convergence for technologies developed since 1925 has been three times higher than the speed of convergence for technologies developed before 1925.},

This study, utilizing administrative data for six cohorts of public school children in North Carolina, demonstrates that those born just after the cut date for enrolling in public kindergarten are more likely to drop out of high school before graduation and to commit a felony offense by age 19. We present suggestive evidence that dropout mediates criminal involvement. Paradoxically, these late-entry students outperform their grade peers academically while still in school, which helps account for the fact that they are less likely to become juvenile delinquents.

abstract = {This handbook serves as a complement to the Handbook on Data Envelopment Analysis (eds, W.W. Cooper, L.M. Seiford, and J, Zhu, 2011, Springer) in an effort to extend the frontier of DEA research. It provides a comprehensive source for the state-of-the art DEA modeling on internal structures and network DEA.   Chapter 1 provides a survey on two-stage network performance decomposition and modeling techniques. Chapter 2 discusses the pitfalls in network DEA modeling. Chapter 3 discusses efficiency decompositions in network DEA under three types of structures, namely series, parallel, and dynamic.  Chapter 4 studies the determination of the network DEA frontier. In chapter 5 additive efficiency decomposition in network DEA is discussed.  An approach in scale efficiency measurement in two-stage networks is presented in chapter 6. Chapter 7 further discusses the scale efficiency decomposition in two stage networks. Chapter 8 offers a bargaining game approach to modeling two-stage networks. Chapter 9 studies shared resources and efficiency decomposition in two-stage networks. Chapter 10 introduces an approach to computing the technical efficiency scores for a dynamic production network and its sub-processes.  Chapter 11 presents a slacks-based network DEA. Chapter 12 discusses a DEA modeling technique for a two-stage network process where the inputs of the second stage include both the outputs from the first stage and additional inputs to the second stage.  Chapter 13 presents an efficiency measurement methodology  for multi-stage production systems. Chapter 14 discusses network DEA models, both static and dynamic. The discussion also explores various useful objective functions that can be applied to the models to find the optimal allocation of resources for processes within the black box, that are normally invisible to DEA. Chapter 15 provides a comprehensive review of various type network DEA modeling techniques. Chapter 16 presents shared resources models for deriving aggregate measures of bank-branch performance, with accompanying component measures that make up that aggregate value. Chapter 17 examines a set of manufacturing plants operating under a single umbrella, with the objective being to use the component or function measures to decide what might be considered as each plant's core business.  Chapter 18 considers problem settings where there may be clusters or groups of DMUs that form a hierarchy. The specific case of a set off electric power plants is examined in this context.  Chapter 19 models bad outputs in two-stage network DEA. Chapter 20 presents an application of network DEA to performance measurement of Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. Chapter 21 presents an application of a two-stage network DEA model for examining the performance of 30 U.S. airline companies. Chapter 22 then presents two distinct network efficiency models that are applied to engineering systems.                                           . },

abstract = {Measuring local government efficiency is a complex task that has to take into account that they usually operate in a heterogeneous context. Therefore, the estimation of relative efficiency measures of their performance needs to account for the effect of contextual and exogenous variables on the production process. This should assure that the respective measures adequately reflect the portion of inefficiency that may be attributable to local authorities. In this paper, we apply time-dependent conditional frontier estimators to assess the performance of the 278 Portuguese mainland municipalities for the 2009-2014 period. By applying this nonparametric approach, we can avoid the strong assumptions on the specification of the estimated production function required by traditional two-stage methods. Furthermore, we examine the effect of contextual and exogenous variables on municipal efficiency levels and technological change. The results reveal that the recent local reforms introduced after the bailout agreement have slightly enhanced the performance of local authorities, but only for small and medium-sized municipalities.},

Furthermore, we examine the effect of contextual variables and time on the shape of the frontier and the distribution of inefficiencies. The results reveal that the local reforms do not seem to have achieved the pursued objective of improving the efficiency of local government performance. However, we can observe a small improvement in the last year of the period after the amalgamation of some civil parishes, thus it seems that this specific process might have had a certain impact in the short term. Moreover, we find that the economic and demographic indicators included as contextual variables in our model play an important role as influencing the production set, although those effects do not seem to vary much over time. This evidence is corroborated after conducting a second-stage nonparametric regression of the conditional efficiency measures over those variables.},

abstract = {One of the limitations of cross-country health expenditure analysis refers to the fact that the financing, the internal organization and political restraints of health care decision-making are country-specific and heterogeneous. Yet, a way through is to examine the influence of such effects in those countries that have undertaken decentralization processes. In such a setting, it is possible to examine potential expenditure spillovers across the geography of a country as well as the influence of the political ideology of regional incumbents and institutional factors on public health expenditure. This paper examines the determinants of public health expenditure within Spanish region-states (Autonomous Communities, ACs),most of themsubject to similar financing structures although exhibiting significant heterogeneity as a result of the increasing decentralization, region-specific political factors along with different use of health care inputs, economic dimension and spatial interactions.},

abstract = {In recent years, land grabbing has become widespread in Latin America, following similar trends in Africa. Multilateral agencies have sought to explain this phenomenon by arguing that these investments in land are driven by the rich endowments of natural resources of the countries in the region. This article argues that this explanation is insufficient: the rich endowment of natural resources in Latin America cannot explain the rising transfer of land to foreign investors, as if it were a natural curse. By contrast, the deepening of development models based almost exclusively on the exploitation of these resources seems to be the key, such that the role of states becomes essential to the explanation. In fact, the emergence of many self-proclaimed ‘progressive' or ‘left' governments in the region has not reversed the established structural dependency, based on an extractivist development model, but has deepened it.},

abstract = {Whether it is fair to characterize natural resource wealth as a curse is still debated. Most of the evidence derives from cross-country analyses, providing cases both for and against a potential resource curse. Scholars are increasingly turning to within-country evidence to deepen our understanding of the potential drivers, and outcomes, of resource wealth effects. Moving away from cross-country studies offers new perspectives on the resource curse debate and can help overcome concerns regarding endogeneity. Therefore, scholars are leveraging datasets that provide greater disaggregation of economic responses and exogenous identification of impacts. This article surveys the literature on these studies of local and regional effects of natural resource extraction. We discuss data availability and quality, recent advances in methodological tools, and the main findings of several research areas. These areas include the direct impact of natural resource production on local labor markets and welfare, the effects of government spending channels resulting from mining revenue, and regional spillovers. Finally, we take stock of the state of the literature and provide suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {Many theories in the social sciences predict spatial dependence or the similarity of behaviors at neighboring locations. Spatial Analysis for the Social Sciences demonstrates how researchers can diagnose and model this spatial dependence and draw more valid inferences as a result. The book is structured around the well-known Galton's problem and presents a step-by-step guide to the application of spatial analysis. The book examines a variety of spatial diagnostics and models through a series of applied examples drawn from the social sciences. These include spatial lag models that capture behavioral diffusion between actors, spatial error models that account for spatial dependence in errors, and models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity in the effects of covariates. Spatial Analysis for the Social Sciences also examines advanced spatial models for time-series cross-sectional data, categorical and limited dependent variables, count data, and survival data.},

abstract = {This paper uses laboratory methods to evaluate whether price-fixing conspiracies break down in the presence of opportunities to offer secret discounts. The primary treatment difference is whether or not buyer-specific discounts from the posted list price are permitted. In standard posted-offer markets, conspiring sellers almost uniformly find and maintain near-monopoly prices.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of local governments in Belgium using a broad variety of non-parametric and parametric reference technologies. Specifically, we calculate indices of cost efficiency for five different reference technologies, two non-parametric ones (Free Disposal Hull (FDH) and variable returns to scale Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)) and three parametric frontiers (one deterministic and two stochastic). We first compare the various alternatives in terms of the efficiency-inefficiency dichotomy, we look at the distributions of the different measures, and we consider the differences in ranking. In a final stage we examine the degree to which the calculated inefficiencies can be explained by a common set of explanatory variables. },

However, a number of alternative methods exist, and they offer researchers the means to develop a more nuanced understanding of the distribution of income. Income inequality measures such as the generalised entropy index and the Atkinson index offer the ability to examine the effects of inequalities in different areas of the income spectrum, enabling more meaningful quantitative assessments of qualitatively different inequalities.

We explain change throughout the distribution of expenditures, providing insight into how expenditure growth and its explanation differ along the distribution. We analyse Dutch data on actual health expenditures linked to hospital discharge and mortality registers. Full distribution decomposition delivers findings that would be overlooked by examination of changes in the mean alone. The growth rate of hospital expenditures is greatest at the middle of the distribution and is driven mainly by changes in the distributions of determinants. Pharmaceutical expenditures increase most rapidly at the top of the distribution and are mainly attributable to structural changes, including technological progress, making treatment of the highest cost cases even more expensive. Changes in hospital practice styles make the largest contribution of all determinants to increased spending not only on hospital care but also on pharmaceuticals, suggesting important spill over effects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We revisit the bi-directional causality between public debt and the rate of GDP growth for 10 EMU countries alongside the US, UK and Japan, over sample periods spanning from 1970 up to 2014 whilst accounting for the nonlinear properties of both the individual time series, and their relation in both directions. Our results indicate that the causal relation between debt and growth, in either direction, is weak at best. For most of the countries in our sample, we find no robust evidence of a long-run causal effect using bi-variate Granger causality tests. Bi-directional causality is detected only for Austria, while for France, Luxembourg and Portugal, causality runs solely from debt to growth, but the estimated effects are very small. In Finland, Spain and Italy, Granger causality (from growth to debt in the former two and debt to growth in Italy) appears to be present in the short-run. Our findings cannot be taken as evidence that a high level of public indebtedness is not risky for the economy or as invalidating hypotheses postulating effects in either direction in the relation between debt and growth. },

abstract = {The Better Life Index was introduced by the OECD as a tool to chart the multidimensional well-being of its member countries. However, the Better Life Index relies only on aggregate country-level indicators, and hence is insensitive to how multidimensional well-being is distributed within countries. This paper discusses how a distribution-sensitive Better Life Index could be designed. A broad family of distribution-sensitive Better Life Indices is discussed and decomposed in interpretable building blocks. While a rich and comprehensive micro-level data set is necessary to implement the distribution-sensitive Better Life Index , no such data set is currently available for all OECD member countries. The paper constructs therefore a ‘synthetic' data set that relies on information about macro-level indicators and micro-level data from the Gallup World Poll . The implementation of the distribution-sensitive Better Life Index is illustrated with this synthetic data set. The illustration indicates that, when taking the distribution of well-being into account, Nordic countries are top-ranked whereas Greece, the Russian Federation and Turkey occupy the bottom positions. The results indicate considerable losses due to multidimensional inequality for OECD member countries. In addition, sizeable differences are found in the level and composition of multidimensional inequality. },

In the first stage, the efficiency of justice service is measured by data envelopment analysis. In the second stage, the results obtained from DEA are regressed with variables affecting the courts by Tobit regression model. In the DEA analysis while number of judges and office staff are used as inputs, resolved cases are used as outputs. In the Tobit regression model while the results obtained from DEA are used as dependent variable, judge salaries, judges' basic education and number of courts are used as explanatory variables. According to Tobit regression model, it's found that there is a positive and significant relation between efficiency of justice service and salaries of judges in European countries. The increase in judge salaries is significant for the efficiency of courts, but it certainly is not only solution for the efficiency of justice services.},

Ageing population distributions and income explain a relatively small portion of health expenditures when the impact of time effects, which is a partial proxy for technological change, is controlled for. However, the impact of age is of more concern given that cost increases are concentrated in the last few years of life and there may be cohort effects as the "Baby-Boom" generation ages. There is an urgent need to better understand the exact mechanisms driving health expenditure increases given that time accounts for approximately two-thirds of health expenditure increases and that its effect is non-linear. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The existence of geographic differences in health resources, health expenditures, the utilization of health services, and health outcomes have been documented by a lot of studies from various countries of the world. In a publicly financed health system, equal access is one of the main objectives of the national health policy. That is why inequalities in the geographic allocation of health resources are an important health policy issue. Measures of inequality express the complexity of variation in the observed variable by a single number, and there is a variety of inequality measures available. The objective of this study is to develop a measure of the geographic inequality in the case of multiple health resources. The measure uses data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric method of production function estimation, to transform multiple resources into a single virtual health resource. The study shows that the DEA originally developed for measuring efficiency can be used successfully to measure inequality. For the illustrative purpose, the inequality measure is calculated for the Czech Republic. The values of separate Robin Hood Indexes (RHIs) are 6.64{\%} for physicians and 3.96{\%} for nurses. In the next step, we use combined RHI for both health resources. Its value 5.06{\%} takes into account that the combinations of two health resources serve regional populations. },

@article{Dollery2008,
abstract = {A common argument advanced by proponents of Australian local council amalgamation proposals is that 'bigger is cheaper' due inter alia to the existence of substantial economies of scale in local council service provision. This argument typically asserts that local councils with larger populations can provide municipal services at lower costs per unit of output than local authorities with smaller population bases, thereby conflating population size with the theoretically distinct concept of scale economies. This short paper examines this argument in the light of standard economic theory. We conclude that it is fallacious to use population size as a proxy for scale economies in Australian local government. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] },

We use conceptual considerations to posit an ideal specification for Australian municipal before estimating a number of models to demonstrate the effect of specification on the identification of determinants. Our evidence suggests that incorrect specification may well produce spurious associations and lead to poor public policymaking. },

Part I discusses basic fundamental issues of well-being and poverty measurement. Part II develops an integrated framework for measuring poverty, social welfare, inequality, vertical equity, horizontal equity, and redistribution. Part III presents and develops recent methods for testing the robustness of distributive rankings. Part IV discusses ways of using policy to alleviate poverty, improve welfare, increase equity, and assess the impact of growth. Part V applies the tools to real data. Most of the book's measurement and statistical tools have been programmed in DAD, a well-established and widely available free software program that has been tailored especially for income-distribution analysis and is used by scholars, researchers, and analysts in nearly 100 countries worldwide. It requires basic understanding of calculus and statistics.},

However, growth rates are highly unstable over time, with a correlation across decades of 0.1 to 0.3, while country characteristics are stable, with cross-decade correlations of 0.6 to 0.9. Shocks, especially those to terms of trade, play a large role in explaining variance in growth. These findings suggest either that shocks are important relative to country characteristics in determining long-run growth, or that worldwide technological change determines long-run growth while country characteristics determine relative income levels.},

Theorems and behavioral implications are derived using the state preference approach to behavior under uncertainty. The investigation deals directly with the interaction between offense and defense: crime and collective law enforcement. It indicates the existence of a deterrent effect of law-enforcement activity on all crimes and a strong positive correlation between income inequality and crimes against property. The empirical results also provide some tentative estimates of the effectiveness of law enforcement in reducing crime and the resulting social losses.},

We show that such indicators can be used both as explanatory variables on the right-hand side and as the phenomenon to explain on the left-hand side. We try out practical ways of adjusting standard errors of the regression coefficients to reflect the error introduced by using imputed, rather than actual, welfare indicators. These are illustrated by regression experiments based on data from Ecuador. For regressions with imputed variables on the left-hand side, we argue that essentially the same aggregate relationships would be found with either actual or imputed variables.

Resume Contrairement a l'ideologie neoliberale dominante affirmant que les taux de croissance economique eleves favorisent a terme une meilleure repartition des revenus, les trois dernieres decennies ont ete marquees par une augmentation des inegalites de revenus dans l plupart des pays a forte croissance dans le monde. De meme, l'abondance en ressources naturelles de certains pays en developpement a des consequences importantes sur la croissance economique et les niveaux d'inegalite de revenus. En favorisant l'augmentation des investissements directs etrangers et l'ouverture des marches, la mondialisation neoliberale exerce aussi une forte pression sur les economies nationales. Cet article examine les effets de la dependance aux ressources naturelles, de la mondialisation neoliberale, de la gestion institutionnelle de l'Etat et des modeles de developpement national sur l'inegalite des revenus dans 96 pays en developpement pour la periode 1980-2010. Des modeles de regression Prais-Winstein avec ecarts types corriges longitudinaux montrent que les taux de croissance de la population sont les facteurs les plus importants intervenants dans le modele de developpement interne. La dependance aux ressources naturelles joue egalement un role important dans l'augmentation des inegalites. Il existe une correlation positive entre l'augmentation des inegalites de revenus et les investissements directs etrangers et une association negative avec l'ouverture des marches. La comparaison des resultats des pays riches en ressources naturelles revele l'importance de la nature des ressources naturelles sur l'inegalite de revenus. Resumen Diferentemente de la ideologia neoliberal predominante que argumento que mayores tasas de crecimiento economico eventualmente conducirian a mejores resultados en terminos de distribucion del ingreso, las ultimas tres decadas fueron testigo de altas tasas de crecimiento economico acompanado por el aumento de las desigualdades de ingresos en la mayoria de paises del mundo. La abundancia de recursos naturales en varios paises en desarrollo tuvo consecuencias importantes en su crecimiento economico y en los niveles de desigualdad de ingresos posteriores. Ademas, la globalizacion neoliberal se manifesto en un aumento de la inversion extranjera directa y la apertura del comercio impacto significativamente en las economias mundiales. Esta investigacion examina los efectos de la dependencia de los recursos naturales, la globalizacion neoliberal y los factores institucionales-del estado, junto con el modelo de desarrollo interno en la desigualdad del ingreso en un conjunto de 96 paises en desarrollo para el periodo 1980-2010. Los modelos de regresion Prais-Winsten con paneles corrigiendo el error estandar muestran que las tasas de crecimiento de la poblacion son el factor mas importante en el modelo de desarrollo interno. La dependencia de los recursos naturales es igualmente importante y se asocia positivamente con el aumento de las desigualdades. La inversion extranjera directa indica una asociacion positiva robusta con el aumento de las desigualdades de ingresos, mientras que la apertura comercial exhibe una asociacion negativa. Finalmente, los resultados para los diferentes tipos de paises ricos en energia revelan la importancia de explorar como los diferentes tipos de recursos naturales podrian tener un efecto mayor en la desigualdad de ingresos en comparacion con su magnitud.;Contrary to predominant neoliberal ideology that argued higher economic growth rates would eventually lead to better results in terms of income distribution, the last three decades witnessed high economic growth rates accompanied by rising income inequalities in most countries worldwide.

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to examine the effect of inequality on crime rates in a unique context, Mexico's drug war. The analysis exploits an original dataset containing inequality and crime statistics on more than 2000 Mexican municipalities over a 20-year period. To uncover the causal effect of inequality on crime, we use an instrumental variable for the Gini coefficient that combines the initial income distribution at the municipality level with national trends. Our estimates indicate that a one-point increment in the Gini coefficient between 2007 and 2010 translates into an increase of more that 36{\%} in the number of drug-related homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. The fact that the effect found during the drug war is substantially greater is likely caused by the rise in rents to be extracted through crime and an expansion in the employment opportunities in the illegal sector through the proliferation of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), accompanied by a decline in legal job opportunities and a reduction in the probability of being caught given the resource constraints faced by the law enforcement system. Combined, the latter factors made the expected benefits of criminal activity shift in a socially undesirable direction after 2007.Sector Board: Poverty (POV) •This paper examines the effect of inequality on crime rates during Mexico's drug war.•It uses a dataset on inequality and crime for more than 2,000 Mexican municipalities.•It instruments for inequality through initial distribution and national income trends.•Finds that a one-point increment in inequality implies a 36 increase in the homicide rate. },

abstract = {Because of Chile's geographical position, earthquakes and tsunamis are recurrent phenomena and reducing vulnerability to these events is imperative. To do this, one needs to understand the geophysical features of the hazards involved and the vulnerability that exposed communities live with. This article presents some unexpected findings of a research regarding the latter and devised to investigate the vulnerability realities that the devastating 2010 earthquake/tsunami event in Chile exposed. Interestingly, this study revealed households that are formally considered resilient in the face of natural hazards, but are in fact not. These households are part of a group I call the emergent middle. The 'middle' because they are neither rich nor poor, but do not fit the typical middle-class category, and 'emergent' because their primary concerns are staying out of poverty and climbing the socioeconomic ladder. The findings of this research suggest that they find themselves in a precarious situation and that their vulnerability to natural hazards largely emerges from their economic fragility and their limited access to relevant resources in the wake of a hazardous event. This article is based on data that were collected through extensive field work in the Greater Concepci{\'{o}}n area and in particular in Talcahuano that was severely hit in 2010. },

Particularly, the case of Chile highlights around the world because it has one of the highest individual and spatial inequality rates. This article analyzes the spatial income inequality in Chile during 1992-2011 evaluating the role of the spatial labor sorting through multilevel models. The findings show that human capital doesn't allocate randomly across the space, but its spatial concentration at the biggest urban centers impacts significantly the income inequality between counties. These findings motivate the discussion about spatial dimension of the inequality and suggest that policymakers should consider ways to spread human capital throughout the nation as an alternative to reduce spatial inequality.},

@unpublished{Fabre2018,
abstract = {This paper brings new evidence on the impact of income inequality on public decisions. Using a new panel database on French municipalities' accounts, and on households' income distribution at the local level, I estimate the impact of income distribution on municipal policy. This paper is the first to investigate this issue by simultaneously using a high number of comparable observations and identifying deciles of the income distribution which matter. After controlling for municipal fixed effects and for the dynamics of municipal incumbents' decisions, I find no impact of income inequality on operating spending, but a strong positive impact on municipal infrastructures. Evidence suggests that an increase in income inequality by 1{\%} leads on average to an increase in the value of municipal infrastructures between 0.06{\%} and 0.18{\%}. Importantly, I find that this result is driven by variations in bottom and top deciles. There is clear evidence that additive public facilities associated to more inequality are due to higher tax rates. When poorest individuals get poorer, or when richest ones get richer, municipal incumbents decide to increase the amount of infrastructures by increasing local taxation. These results suggest that what matter in public decisions are the extreme parts of voters' income distribution, and that lower bottom incomes and higher top ones both lead to a higher size of government.},

abstract = {We investigate the robustness and causality of the link between income inequality and violent crime across countries. First, we study the correlation between the Gini index and homicide and robbery rates within and between countries. Second, we examine the partial correlation by considering other crime determinants. Third, we control for the endogeneity of inequality by isolating its exogenous impact on these crime rates. Fourth, we control for measurement error in crime rates by modeling it as both unobserved country effects and random noise. Finally, we examine the robustness of this partial correlation to alternative measures of inequality. The panel data consist of nonoverlapping 5year averages for 39 countries during 196595 for homicides and 37 countries during 197094 for robberies. Crime rates and inequality are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling for other crime determinants. },

abstract = {According to the standard economic perspective, criminal activities vary with the `price' of crime, which depends on the severity of punishment and the detection probability. An alternative view claims that crime is also influenced by social interaction phenomena, such as `peer pressure' or `neighbourhood effects'. Detecting social interaction in the field is fraught with difficulties, however. In this paper, it is argued that given its extensive control possibilities, experiments are well suited to show the potential existence of social interaction effects. An experimental study where people can engage in `criminal' activities is presented. Support is found for the importance of social interaction: On average subjects steal the more, the more others steal. This behaviour can be interpreted in terms of reciprocity. },

abstract = {Italian health care expenditure (HCE) has been basically explained with two main groups of theories. (1) Those explaining the peculiarity of the HCE growth as depending on demand and supply factors, such as aging population, number of practising physicians per capita, mix of public and private hospitals, number of hospital beds,... (2) Those explaining the growth of total public expenditure as a common feature among industrialized countries, with a huge empirical literature emphasising the role of GDP and/or other structural/institutional variables as the main determinants of HCE across countries. In order to reassess previous findings, we exploit recent results on panel cointegration analysis and test the regional Italian data on HCE and GDP, also taking into account cross-section correlation. The results show that HCE and GDP are cointegrated. The long- and short-term dynamics of HCE are estimated. Our results, providing an empirical support for the existence of Wagner's law, have important policy implications in terms of fiscal sustainability: as income rises, people will choose relatively more HCE. Given the level of the public debt in Italy, any further increases would imply that future government spending may be mainly directed toward debt servicing, likely at the expense of public expenditure on basic infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {This study tests the effects of neighborhood inequality and heterogeneity on crime rates. The results of this study, which were obtained by using a large sample of census tracts in 19 cities in 2000, provide strong evidence of the importance of racial/ethnic heterogeneity for the amount of all types of crime generally committed by strangers, even controlling for the effects of income inequality. Consistent with predictions of several theories, greater overall inequality in the tract was associated with higher crime rates, particularly for violent types of crime. Strong evidence revealed that within racial/ethnic group inequality increases crime rates: Only the relative deprivation model predicted this association. An illuminating finding is that the effect of tract poverty on robbery and murder becomes nonsignificant when the level of income inequality is taken into account; this finding suggests that past studies that failed to take income inequality into account may have inappropriately attributed causal importance to poverty. This large sample also provides evidence that it is the presence of homeowners, rather than residential stability (as measured by the average length of residence), that significantly reduces the level of crime in neighborhoods. },

abstract = {Research on the effects of positional concerns on individuals' attitudes and behavior is sorely lacking. To address this deficiency, we use the International Social Survey Programme 1998 data on 25,000 individuals from 26 countries to investigate the impact of relative income position on three facets of social capital: horizontal and vertical trust as well as norm compliance. Testing relative deprivation theory, we identify a deleterious positional income effect for persons below the reference income, particularly for their social trust and confidence in secular institutions. Also often a social capital-lowering effect of relative income advantage occurs, while a rise in absolute income almost always contributes positively. These results indicate that a rise in income inequality in a society too large is rather detrimental to the formation of social capital.

abstract = {As mining expands throughout the world, a growing body of literature is focusing on the relationship between mining and well-being in locations where resource extraction occurs. Although many topics such as employment and migration have been researched, the impacts of mining on income inequality have received less attention from scholars. Income inequality is a highly debated topic and the Gini coefficient (GC) one of the most popular indicators used to measure and discuss it. In this paper we estimate GCs for all sub-State regions of Australia and analyse their changes during the 'mining boom decade' (2001-11) across mining and non-mining regions. Our results show that, on average, income inequality increased by around 4.8 per cent in mining regions, compared to 8.7 per cent in the average non-mining region. However, the results also show important variation in changes of GC across mining regions, suggesting that the industry is likely to affect the distribution of local incomes in different ways. The method we propose to estimate GCs for regional areas and the results obtained across mining and non-mining regions provide important insights for future research and for regional policy makers, especially those concerned with the socio-economic impacts of industries such as mining across regions.},

abstract = {Complementing the scarce economic literature about local impacts of energy extraction booms, this paper empirically investigates economic outcomes related to the new coal seam gas (CSG) industry located across southern Queensland. This Australian state has seen an unprecedented inflow of investments into the extraction of this previously unexploited unconventional natural gas over the last decade. We analyse census data to study income and employment effects associated with the CSG boom, exploiting the quasi-experimental conditions provided by CSG extraction areas (treatment regions) and regions without this development (control regions). Findings show that treatment regions have higher income growth than control areas during 2001-2011 for families residing locally and for individuals present on census night. Employment in the mining sector also shows higher growth as has non-mining employment in some areas. We include comparisons between CSG areas with no major mining history (the Surat basin) and CSG areas where mining was important before the CSG boom (the Bowen basin), to better understand boom effects in areas with different initial mining industry importance in their economies. Local job multipliers are also analysed for Surat basin CSG areas, where positive impacts (job spillovers) are restricted to construction and professional services jobs, while agricultural jobs have decreased.},

It also examines the institution and economic factors influencing spending efficiency in these sectors in the countries selected for the period 2000--2012. The public sector efficiency scores are estimated in the first stage by using the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach while in the second stage, the panel data Tobit and the Fractional Logit regression techniques are used to determine the effect of institutional and economic factors on public spending efficiency in the education and health sectors. The results from the estimation show that Cameroon is more efficient than Chad and Central African Republic in its public spending in education and health. Chad is least efficient in public spending in education, although it spends more on education as compared to the other countries in the study. The results also indicate that the quality of budgetary and financial management has a positive and statistically significant influence on efficiency while corruption has a negative and significant influence on public spending efficiency in the education and health sectors. The results put together recommend that efforts should be put in place to curb corruption and improve on the quality of budgetary and financial management.},

This book should help to enrich discussion and analysis relating to the World Bank's recent effort toward defining new targets and indicators for promoting work on eradicating poverty and enhancing shared prosperity.;A Unified Approach to Measuring Poverty and Inequality: Theory and Practice is an introduction to the theory and practice of measuring poverty and inequality, as well as a user's guide for analyzing income or consumption distribution for any standard household dataset using the World Bank's ADePT software. The approach taken here considers income standards as building blocks for basic measurement, then uses them to construct inequality and poverty measures. This unified approach provides advantages in interpreting and contrasting the measures and in understanding the way measures vary over time and space.Several recent initiatives have lowered the cost of accessing household datasets. The ADePT software enables users to analyze microdata from household surveys and other sources and generate print-ready, standardized tables and charts. It can also be used to simulate the impact of economic shocks, cash transfers and other policy instruments on poverty, and i equality. The software automates analysis, helps minimize human errors, and encourages development of new economic analysis methods. Of interest to teachers and students as well as to policy practitioners, A Unified Approach to Measuring Poverty and Inequality will empower researchers to plumb greater depths in searching for regularity in larger and larger datasets. This book should help to enrich discussion and analysis relating to the World Bank's recent effort toward defining new targets and indicators for promoting work on eradicating poverty and enhancing shared prosperity.;},

abstract = {This paper examines performance in a tournament setting with different levels of inequality in rewards and different provision of information about individual's skill at the task prior to the tournament. We find that that total tournament output depends on inequality according to an inverse U shaped function: We reward subjects based on the number of mazes they can solve, and the number of solved mazes is lowest when payments are independent of the participants' performance; rises to a maximum at a medium level of inequality; then falls at the highest level of inequality. These results are strongest when participants know the number of mazes they solved relative to others in a pre-tournament round and thus can judge their likely success in the tournament. Finally, we find that cheating/fudging on the experiment responds to the level of inequality and information about relative positions. Our results support a model of optimal allocation of prizes in tournaments that postulate convex cost of effort functions.},

abstract = {Highlights► We point out some problems associated with existing network DEA models. ► We propose a network approach for identifying the efficiency status of each DMU and its divisions. ► Our approach provides a practical computational procedure. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is commonly employed to evaluate the efficiency performance of a decision making unit (DMU) that transforms exogenous inputs into final outputs. In such a black-box DEA approach, details of an internal production process of the DMU are typically ignored and hence the locations of inefficiency are not adequately provided. In view of this, DEA researchers have recently developed various network approaches by looking into the black box, where the inputs that enter the box and the outputs that come out of it are only considered. However, most of these network approaches evaluate divisional efficiency by using an optimal solution of their respective optimization problem. If such an optimal solution is used in the case when there are multiple optima, then managerial guidance based on this solution alone may be inappropriate because more appropriate targets from the viewpoint of management may be ignored. Taking this fact into account, therefore, we propose a network approach for identifying the efficiency status of each DMU and its divisions. This approach provides a practical computational procedure. },

@article{Gaitan-Rossi2018,
abstract = {In the last decade, Mexico, the second largest economy in Latin America, has seen high poverty, inequality, and increasing homicide rates, which has led to widespread fear of crime. Two important challenges to understand the elevated levels of fear of crime are the lack of agreement on how to measure it and the debate on whether it responds to actual crime or to a general feeling of vulnerability associated with poverty. Moreover there is little research in Mexico examining the complex influence of social context at the municipality level, on the relationship between person-level characteristics and fear of crime. Using Mexico's 2015 National Survey of Victimization the goal of the study is to estimate a two-level hierarchical regression analysis combining the effects of person-level predictors and municipality level context variables to explain fear of crime in Mexico´s urban population. Our results show that some person level attributes—victimization, incivilities, trust, police effectiveness, and collective organization—are consistently associated with the three domains of fear of crime: feelings of insecurity, perceptions of risk, and avoidance behaviors. The study shows that homicide rates at the municipality level are directly associated with feelings of insecurity and avoidance behaviors. In addition, high multidimensional poverty and inequality at the municipality level amplified the rate by which incivilities affect perceptions of risk. Unexpectedly, collective efficacy at the municipality level and collective organization to solve crime at the individual level were positive and significant predictors for fear of crime in Mexico. },

A partir de 2006 la deuda p{\'{u}}blica del Tamaulipas comienza a tener un crecimiento pronunciado y entre 2009 y 2011 su crecimiento se hace exponencial. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar el endeudamiento p{\'{u}}blico en Tamaulipas y compararlo con la evoluci{\'{o}}n del gasto p{\'{u}}blico, indicando cu{\'{a}}les partidas y adonde se ha orientado el gasto en el periodo (2003-2013). Inicialmente se exploran las condiciones que inciden sobre el endeudamiento p{\'{u}}blico de los estados, como baja presi{\'{o}}n fiscal, ausencia de soberan{\'{i}}a fiscal (recaudaci{\'{o}}n centralizada), elevados gastos p{\'{u}}blicos estatales por compromisos de los partidos gobernantes, limitada transparencia p{\'{u}}blica sobre la informaci{\'{o}}n financiera, entre otras. En la segunda parte se analiza el proceso de endeudamiento del estado en relaci{\'{o}}n con las transferencias federales y se analiza la aplicaci{\'{o}}n de los recursos transferidos de acuerdo a los presupuestos de egresos de ese periodo. Por {\'{u}}ltimo, se presentan las conclusiones as{\'{i}} como una valoraci{\'{o}}n de la situaci{\'{o}}n actual que Tamaulipas presenta en t{\'{e}}rminos de endeudamiento. Se constat{\'{o}} que a pesar del crecimiento acelerado de la deuda y el gasto p{\'{u}}blico en Tamaulipas en el periodo analizado, ello no se ha traducido en tasas de crecimiento econ{\'{o}}mico equiparables, sino que ha perdido posiciones en diversos rankings de competitividad y seguridad. The phenomena of the size and the growth rate of the public debt in federative entities in Mexico has taken high importance during the last years. Since 2006, the public debt of Tamaulipas started to have an accelerated growth and, between 2009 and 2011, its growth has been exponential. The objective of this paper is to analyze the public indebtedness of Tamaulipas and compare to the evolution of public expenditure, pointing out which budget segments and where has been oriented the public expenditure in the period of 2003-2013. Initially, it is explored the conditions that have an effect on over the public indebtedness in the states, as low fiscal pressure, absence of fiscal sovereignty (as centralized fiscal collection), elevated public expenditure due to the commitments of the governing parties, limited transparency over the financial information, among others. In the second part, it is studied the process of growth of the state public debt in relation to the federal transfers and it is analyzed the application of the transferred economic resources according to the expenditure budgets during the indicated period. Lastly, several conclusions are presented as well as a valorization of the current situation that Tamaulipas maintains in terms of public debt. It was possible to determine that in despite of the fast-paced growth of the public debt and the public expenditure of Tamaulipas during the period 2003-2013, this conditions has not been translated into similar economic growth rates, au contraire Tamaulipas have lost several positions in the public safety and competitive rankings. },

abstract = {The paper undertakes a comparative efficiency analysis of public bus transport in Spain using Data Envelopment Analysis. A procedure for efficiency evaluation was established with a view to estimating its technical and scale efficiency. Principal components analysis allowed us to reduce a large number of potential measures of supply- and demand-side and quality outputs in three statistical factors assumed in the analysis of the service. A statistical analysis (Tobit regression) shows that efficiency levels are negative in relation to the population density and peak-to-base ratio. Nevertheless, efficiency levels are not related to the form of ownership (public versus private). The results obtained for Spanish public transport show that the average pure technical and scale efficiencies are situated at 94.91 and 52.02{\%}, respectively. The excess of resources is around 6{\%}, and the increase in accessibility of the service, one of the principal components summarizing the large number of output measures, is extremely important as a quality parameter in its performance. },

abstract = {Research Summary Broken windows theory (and policing strategies based on this perspective) predicts that citizens' perceptions of disorder in their communities cause fear and social withdrawal, which thereby opens the streets for serious predatory crime. A key assumption, therefore, is that the primary exogenous variable in the broken windows process (disorder) and its outcome variable (crime) are actually separate constructs. The empirical evidence regarding the discriminant validity of measures of disorder and crime, however, is mixed. This confusion is caused in part by the general reliance on comparing ?objective? indicators of disorder and crime (e.g., using systematic social observations of disorder and/or official records of crime), which fail to capture the social meaning ascribed to disorder by community residents that may trigger the broken windows process. To address this issue, the current study presents competing confirmatory factor analytic models to test the relative fit of one- and two-factor models of citizens' perceptions of disorder and crime in their communities. The results show that the two-factor model is inappropriate because of a high correlation between perceptions of disorder and crime. The primary implication of this finding is that broken windows theory and order maintenance policing need to be reconsidered. Policy Implications Broken windows, or order maintenance policing, is premised on the idea that citizens recognize disorder as a problem apart from crime and that reducing disorder will cause a decline in fear. The results of the current study refute the underlying logic of order maintenance policing by demonstrating that survey respondents did not, in fact, distinguish between disorder and crime. This result has implications both for the actual effectiveness of order maintenance policing in terms of crime reduction and for citizens' satisfaction with police agencies that focus more on disorder than on serious crime.},

In assessing inefficiency derivation, we focus on socio-economic and political characteristics of the municipalities as potential source. Our main findings indicate that while the socio-economic make-up of the population (i.c. income, income inequality, education and unemployment) appears to bear little relation to local (in)efficiency, the reverse holds for the municipal financial situation (i.c. grants, historical debt and fiscal surplus) as well as population size and density. Also, different types of communities - i.e. agricultural, residential, industrial, touristic or urbanized - are generally found to achieve comparable performance levels in providing 'core' public services. While indicative, the limitations of our dataset imply that further work is vital before definitive conclusions (as well as causal inferences) can be made. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] },

It has raised questions about inequalities not only between regions (interregional) but inequalities within each region. Hence, one contribution of this paper is to test the effects of aggregation and scale on the identification of regional inequalities using currently accepted spatial analytic methods. The results indicate that overall inequalities are decreasing; however spatial dependence is becoming more dominant. The Theil Index indicates that interregional inequalities are increasing while intraregional inequalities are declining for all spatial partitions from 1980 to 1997. Most developed provinces are enhancing overall inequalities, although there is some evidence of a spread effect on their neighbours.},

The results show a continuous increase of absolute global inequality during 1850–2010, which can be separated into three distinct phases: (1) between 1850 and 1929, within-country inequality explained up to 76 {\%} of absolute global inequality, yet the growth rates of within- and between-country inequality were very similar; (2) a sharp increase in the importance of between-country inequality occurred during the 1929–1950 period, which was followed by a period during which the within- and between-country components were approximately equally relevant; and (3) after 1985, the growth in absolute global inequality was driven primarily by the accelerated growth of within-country income differences. Currently, within-country inequality explains 70 {\%} of absolute global market inequality, a figure close to that of the year 1850. Additional findings include that absolute income convergence between countries took place after 2005, that it is possible to reduce absolute inequality and to grow simultaneously, and that recently within-country net inequality has grown faster than market inequality. The main findings are preserved when different absolute decomposable inequality measures, sample sizes, and purchasing power parity exchange rates are used.},

abstract = {Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz explore long-run changes in the U.S. wage structure. Differences in wages across high and low earners declined from 1910 to 1950, were roughly stable in the 1950s and 1960s, and increased rapidly after 1980. The widening of wage inequality during the past quarter century occurred in two stages: Initially, wages at the top of the distribution rose fastest, wages in the middle rose less rapidly, and wages at the bottom rose least of all. Since the late 1980s, wages at the top have continued to increase relative to wages in the middle, but wages in the middle have not risen further relative to wages at the bottom. This recent polarization of wage changes is mirrored in employment, with shifts into high-wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of middle-wage positions. In explaining these patterns, Goldin and Katz place most of the weight on changes in the return to education. They show that skill-biased technological change has generated rapid growth in the demand for more-educated workers for at least the past century. During much of this time, rising educational attainment generated even faster growth in the supply of skills, which narrowed wage differentials. However, the advance of educational attainment slowed after 1980, with a stagnant high school graduation rate and only modest increases in the share of young adults completing fouryear college degrees. This slowdown caused a sharp decline in the relative growth of skill supply, which led to wider wage differentials. Goldin and Katz also assert that computers are substitutes for the skills characteristic of many middle-wage jobs but are complements for the abstract tasks required in many high-wage jobs and have little bearing on low-wage jobs; this combination depresses employment and wages in the middle of the wage distribution.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, many OECD countries adopted fiscal consolidation strategies to reduce their debt-to-GDP ratios. This paper investigates the effects of fiscal consolidation on trading partners' growth through trade linkages. Using a measure of exogenous fiscal shocks in export markets, fiscal consolidation spillovers are found to slow down domestic growth and decrease employment. To the extent that fiscal consolidations are synchronised, fiscal policies have large spillover effects on output. Spillovers of fiscal consolidations on growth are found to be initially larger between countries belonging to currency unions, though this larger impact vanishes over the medium term. Larger spillovers of fiscal consolidation coincide with lower bilateral exports, higher bilateral imports and relative increases in unit labour costs in currency unions. Spillovers of fiscal consolidation are also found to be more detrimental to domestic growth during economic downturns in export markets.},

abstract = {We gauge how productivity and factor endowments shaped the rise and fall of Australia's exceptional incomes using new measures of total factor productivity (TFP), which include natural resource inputs, in an accounting of income growth. Further, we explore the drivers of TFP growth. Pastoralism and mining had negative TFP externalities, and we incorporate these findings into a unified accounting of incomes, which distinguishes the roles of endowments and productivity. Nevertheless, TFP growth played an important role in promoting exceptional incomes between 1842 and 1890. Our findings favour a more balanced interpretation of Australian growth that has roles for natural resources, labour participation, and productivity.},

abstract = {This proceedings volume examines state-of-the art of productivity and efficiency analysis and adds to the existing research by bringing together a selection of the best papers from the 8th North American Productivity Workshop (NAPW). It also aims to analyze world-wide perspectives on challenges that local economies and institutions may face when changes in productivity are observed. The volume comprises seventeen papers that deal with productivity measurement, productivity growth, dynamics of productivity change, measures of labor productivity, measures of technical efficiency in different sectors, frontier analysis, measures of performance, industry instability and spillover effects. These papers are relevant to academia, but also to public and private sectors in terms of the challenges firms, financial institutions, governments and individuals may face when dealing with economic and education related activities that lead to increases or decreases of productivity. The North American Productivity Workshop brings together academic scholars and practitioners in the field of productivity and efficiency analysis from all over the world. It is a four day conference exploring topics related to productivity, production theory and efficiency measurement in economics, management science, operations research, public administration, and related fields. The papers in this volume also address general topics as health, energy, finance, agriculture, utilities, and economic  development, among others. The editors are comprised of the 2014 local organizers, program committee members, and celebrated guest conference speakers. },

It also investigates the role of governance on the effectiveness of public education and health expenditures. The effectiveness of public education and health expenditures is examined within education and health production function by using 2002- 2012 data. Empirical results show that effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors and demographic structure on education and health outcomes are similar to those in previous studies. The results indicate two important findings. First, public education and health expenditures remain incapable to explain outcomes when compared to other socioeconomic variables. Second, increase in public education and health expenditures is associated with improved outcomes just in countries where regulatory quality and control of corruption is high. With a general expression, public education and health expenditures become more effective in countries with high governance level.},

abstract = {The contribution of new technology to economic growth can only be realized when and if the new technology is widely diffused and used. Diffusion itself results from a series of individual decisions to begin using the new technology, decisions which are often the result of a comparison of the uncertain benefits of the new invention with the uncertain costs of adopting it. An understanding of the factors affecting this choice is essential both for economists studying the determinants of growth and for the creators and producers of such technologies. Section II of this article discusses the modeling of diffusion and Sections III to V explore the determinants of diffusion and the evidence for their importance.},

abstract = {A country's mix of products predicts its subsequent pattern of diversification and economic growth. But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products—as measured by the Economic Complexity Index—have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI of the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product represents in that country's export basket). We use this measure together with the network of related products—or product space—to illustrate how the development of new products is associated with changes in income inequality. These findings show that economic complexity captures information about an economy's level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a country's productive structure may limit its range of income inequality.

abstract = {The share of health care expenditure in GDP rises rapidly in virtually all OECD countries, causing increasing concern among politicians and the general public. Yet, economists have to date failed to reach an agreement on what the main determinants of this development are. This paper revisits Baumol's [Baumol, W.J., 1967. Macroeconomics of unbalanced growth: the anatomy of urban crisis. American Economic Review 57 (3), 415-426] model of 'unbalanced growth', showing that the latter offers a ready explanation for the observed inexorable rise in health care expenditure. The main implication of Baumol's model in this context is that health care expenditure is driven by wage increases in excess of productivity growth. This hypothesis is tested empirically using data from a panel of 19 OECD countries. Our tests yield robust evidence in favor of Baumol's theory.},

abstract = {A significant proportion of the trade basket of many developing countries is comprised of primary commodities. This implies relative price movements in commodities may have important consequences for economic growth and poverty reduction. Taking a long-run perspective, we examine the historical relation between a new aggregate index of commodity prices, economic activity, and interest rates. Initial empirical tests show that commodity prices present a downward trend with breaks over the entire industrial age, providing clear support for the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis. It would also appear that this trend has declined at a faster rate since the 1870s. Conversely, several GDP series such as World, Chile, China, UK, and US, trend upward with breaks. Such trending behavior in both commodity prices and economic activity suggests a latent common factor like technological innovation. To assess the relationships between economic series, we apply a stationary VAR (Vector Autoregression) to model movements around trends. Strikingly, there is evidence that commodity prices Granger cause income and interest rates, while interest rates Granger cause commodity prices. From these results and the related impulse response function analysis, the historical perspective provides some useful information for contemporary policy makers. For example, loose monetary policy has tended to support higher commodity prices. Moreover, commodity price movements have an asymmetric country effect on economic activity; periods of falling commodity prices will support GDP growth for commodity importers like the US but depress growth for commodity exporters such as Chile.},

We look for instances of rapid acceleration in economic growth that are sustained for at least 8 years and identify more than 80 such episodes since the 1950s. Growth accelerations tend to be correlated with increases in investment and trade, and with real exchange rate depreciations. Political-regime changes are statistically significant predictors of growth accelerations. External shocks tend to produce growth accelerations that eventually fizzle out, while economic reform is a statistically significant predictor of growth accelerations that are sustained. However, growth accelerations tend to be highly unpredictable: the vast majority of growth accelerations are unrelated to standard determinants and most instances of economic reform do not produce growth accelerations.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Government spending in developing countries typically account for between 15 and 30 percent of GDP. Hence, small changes in the efficiency of public spending could have a major impact on GDP and on the attainment of the government's objectives. The first challenge that stakeholders face is measuring efficiency. This paper attempts such quantification and has two major parts. The first part estimates efficiency as the distance between observed input-output combinations and an efficiency frontier (defined as the maximum attainable output for a given level of inputs). This frontier is estimated for several health and education output indicators by means of the Free Disposable Hull (FDH) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) techniques. Both input-inefficiency (excess input consumption to achieve a level of output) and output-inefficiency (output shortfall for a given level of inputs) are scored in a sample of 140 countries using data from 1996 to 2002. The second part of the paper seeks to verify empirical regularities of the cross-country variation in efficiency. Results show that countries with higher expenditure levels register lower efficiency scores, as well as countries where the wage bill is a larger share of the government's budget. Similarly, countries with higher ratios of public to private financing of the service provision score lower efficiency, as do countries plagued by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and those with higher income inequality. Countries with higher aid-dependency ratios also tend to score lower in efficiency, probably due to the volatility of this type of funding that impedes medium term planning and budgeting. Though no causality may be inferred from this exercise, it points at different factors to understand why some countries might need more resources than others to achieve similar educational and health outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

abstract = {Health care expenditure has increased substantially in all Western industrialized countries in the last decades. The necessity to contain the increase in health care expenditure has motivated the analysis of its determinants to explain differences across countries and health systems. However, recent studies have questioned the use of cross section data arguing that health systems are too different to allow for such comparisons. In this paper we investigate whether this criticism is really justified. We analyze the variations of health care expenditure in OECD countries relative to income, population aging and technological change. Our analysis is based on pooled cross section data and time series. Firstly, formulating error correction models for individual countries we demonstrate that in almost all cases the investigated variables are cointegrated. Secondly, we use a bootstrap framework for inference and examine whether the influence of explanatory variables is unique across countries. Applying recursive estimation procedures we find evidence for cross country homogeneity during the period 1961-1979. In the last two decades health care dynamics become more and more country specific thus indicating divergence of health systems and the growing importance of country-specific effects in the explanation of differences in health care expenditure.},

However, explanations for this association are not well developed. Using data collected from a sample of low-income women with children from Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we explore the possibility that perceptions of neighborhood disorder encourage heavy drinking. Drawing on Conger's (Q. J. Stud. Alcohol 17 (1956) 296) tension reduction hypothesis, we propose that the stress of living in a neighborhood characterized by problems with drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, unemployment, idle youth, abandoned houses, and unresponsive police can be psychologically distressing and lead some people to consume alcohol as a means of palliative escape, to regulate feelings of anxiety and depression. In support of the tension reduction hypothesis, we find that the positive association between neighborhood disorder and heavy drinking is largely mediated by anxiety and depression.},

We question this assumption theoretically, proposing a household-level model showing that neighborhood crime might also change these structural characteristics. We test these hypotheses using data on census tracts in 13 cities over a ten-year period, and our cross-lagged models generally find that, if anything, crime is the stronger causal force in these possible relationships. Neighborhoods with more crime tend to experience increasing levels of residential instability, more concentrated disadvantage, a diminishing retail environment, and more African Americans ten years later. Although we find that neighborhoods with more concentrated disadvantage experience increases in violent and property crime, there is no evidence that residential instability or the presence of African Americans increases crime rates ten years later.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} This article highlights the importance of considering the proper level of aggregation when estimating neighborhood effects. Using a unique nonrural subsample from a large national survey (the American Housing Survey) at three time points that allows placing respondents in blocks and census tracts, this study tests the appropriate level of aggregation of the structural characteristics hypothesized to affect block-level perceptions of crime and disorder. I find that structural characteristics differ in their effects based on the level of aggregation employed. While the effects of racial/ethnic heterogeneity are fairly robust to the geographical level of aggregation, the stronger effects, when measured at the level of the surrounding census tract, suggest more dispersed networks are important for perceived crime and disorder. In contrast, economic resources only show a localized effect when aggregating to the block-level and differ based on the outcome; higher average income reduces disorder but increases crime, most likely by increasing the number of attractive targets. Additionally, the presence of broken households has a localized effect for social disorder but a more diffuse effect for perceived crime. These findings suggest the need for neighborhood studies of crime rates, as well as the broader neighborhood effects literature, to consider the mechanisms involved when aggregating various structural characteristics. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

By using a unique sample of households nested in household clusters, this study teased out the degree of systematic bias on the part of respondents when perceiving crime and disorder. The findings are generally consistent with theoretical expectations of which types of residents will perceive more crime or disorder and contrast with the generally mixed results of prior studies that used an inappropriate aggregate unit when assuming that residents live in the same social context of crime or disorder. Estimating ancillary models on a sample of respondents nested in tracts produced mixed results that mirror the existing literature.

It also shows that females, those with children, and those with longer residence in the neighborhood perceive more crime or disorder than their neighbors. },

In this article, we investigate the impact of deprivation indicators on crime in Belgian municipalities (n = 589) for the period 2001–06. A spatial regression analysis demonstrates that unemployment figures have a strong and significant impact on crime rates, and this effect is stronger than the effect of income levels. Income inequality has a significant positive impact on property crime rates but a negative impact on violent crime. Crime is heavily concentrated in the urban centres of Belgium, but we also observe some important regional variations. Demographic structure was not related to crime levels, while spatial analysis shows there is a spill-over effect to neighbouring communities for property crime, but not for violent crime. We close with some theoretical and policy considerations on the relation between unemployment and crime.},

abstract = {Do abundant resources have any effect on the economic development of countries or are them the cause of a resource curse? The controversy generated about this research area is still active in many analytical frameworks. This paper makes a thorough empirical research on the relationship between resource abundant countries in Latin America and their economic growth. Scholars have found different arguments to argue about the resource curse existence and literature about the resource abundance and the most representative variables that can have effect on it, they all englobe general variables such as production, openness and investment as the most influent ones on the issue. The paper focuses on Latin American countries which are resource endowed and analyze their economies' behavior to find out the relevant issues that put them in their current position on the world. In general terms, the findings reveal that after controlling the relevant variables such as labor force, production, openness, and investment the relationship and influence of the primary goods exports on the economy is not as significant as it was though, especially during the last 25 years, when there has been more globalization, industrialization, technologic growth, and other factors that could have changed the economies in Latin American countries. The results showed that the variables related with trade, exports or Natural Resource production had less impact in the economy lately; however, variables very related with investment, resource allocation, income distribution and others directly related with governmental decisions have more impact in Latin American economies, since problems such as corruption and bureaucracy have been causing major issues throughout the history. Natural resource endowment for Latin American countries had lead these economies to work focused on their production; nonetheless, in recent years, evidence does not show the existence of a “resource curse” but a poor governmental management which has taken Latin American economies to challenging economic episodes during the course of the history.},

The introduction of FPE policy is, however, a huge challenge for any national government that has experienced declining or slow economic growth and heavily relied on charging fees to parents and other sources to finance the education system. It follows, therefore, that the approach taken in implementing the FPE policy has implications for equity and efficiency in the education sector. Malawi and Ghana have differently implemented FPE policy. In this article we assess the impact of the implementation approach taken by each of the two countries on equity and efficiency in their education systems. },

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The paper briefly reviews the main theories formulated over time on the economic effects of public indebtedness, with the aim to highlight their common and divergent points, the arguments they rely upon, as well as their relevance, given the current economic environment. Three major views are considered, namely the classical one, the Keynesian one and the view of neoliberal economists (monetarist economists and representatives of the school of rational expectations). The comparative approach of the different views allowed us to shape some criteria of decision which may prove useful for public policymakers in formulating public debt policies conducive to economic growth: public indebtedness should not become common practice but be reserved for those situations in which the economy is confronted with unusual phenomena, such as economic downturns; borrowed resources should be used especially on those destinations which create added value in the economy, such as public investment; public debt should not accumulate at a fast pace and should be kept within reasonable limits, to avoid possible side effects on economic growth.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our hypothesis is that, although public indebtedness may fuel economic growth, once public debt breaches a certain threshold the effects are reversed and public indebtedness negatively affects GDP growth rates. The results of our study confirm this kind of relationship, with a maximum debt threshold for all countries of about 45-55{\%} of GDP, lower for the less developed (like Romania and Bulgaria) and higher for the more developed ones. Also, the threshold for Central and Eastern European countries is found to be lower than the one identified in other empirical studies for developed EU countries, as the former enjoy lower credibility, higher vulnerability to shocks and depend more on external capital transfers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We compare 'posted-offer' markets where sellers (but not buyers) are all conspiratorial opportunities with observations from three control groups: (1) posted-offer markets without conspiratorial opportunities, (2) 'double-auction' markets with conspiratorial opportunities and (3) posted-offer markets with true single-seller monopolists. The basic conclusions generated by our experimental design are: (1) seller conspiracies in posted-offer markets tend to raise prices (but not profits) relative to similarly organized markets without conspiracies, (2) posted-offer conspiracies tend to generate higher prices (but not profits) than double-auction conspiracies, and (3) posted-offer monopolies tend to generate higher profits (but not prices) then posted-offer conspiracies. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

Based on a cost-benefit analysis, an individual's decision to engage in crime in the rational model is consistent in the short-and long-term. Present-oriented individuals, however, focus on the short-term benefits without particular concern for the long-term consequences of their actions. The radical political economic model focuses on the following key political and socio-economic factors that sustain crime: relative deprivation, poverty and inequality, unemployment, and class conflict. The conclusion includes a conceptual map integrating the three frameworks.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to decompose income inequality across various household income components and to estimate the marginal effects of changes in each of the income components on overall income inequality in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from the fifth and sixth rounds of the Ghana Living Standards Surveys. Gini coefficient was estimated and decomposed across structured income components. The marginal effects were obtained by computing the partial derivatives of the Gini coefficient with respect to a percentage change in a particular income source. Findings The results suggest that, in general, income inequality has increased marginally over the years (Gini coefficient of 0.66 in 2013 and 0.62 in 2006). Inequality was, however, higher in urban areas than in rural areas in 2013 with the reverse observed in 2006. The income component decomposition analysis suggests that wage employment income dominated household income in both rural and urban areas, even though the magnitude was higher in urban areas. Farm income was only dominant in rural communities in 2006. Self-employment and remittance income had consistent inequality reducing effects on total household income distribution. Originality/value The study goes beyond inequality studies in Ghana to estimate the marginal effect of income components on inequality. Such decomposition will allow for effective policy targeting in a resource-constrained developing country like Ghana.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that countries with greater levels of income inequality also have lower levels of intergenerational mobility. This relationship, known as the Great Gatsby Curve (GGC), has been prominently cited by high-ranking public policymakers, bestselling authors, and Nobel Prize–winning academics. Yet, relatively little cross-national work has empirically examined the mechanisms thought to underpin the GGC—particularly with regard to the role of educational attainment. This paper uses the cross-nationally comparable Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data set to shed new light on this issue. We find that income inequality is associated with several key components of the intergenerational transmission process—including access to higher education, the financial returns on education, and the residual effect of parental education upon labor-market earnings. Thus, consistent with theoretical models, we find that educational attainment is an important driver of the relationship between intergenerational mobility and income inequality. We hence conclude that unequal access to financial resources plays a central role in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.},

abstract = {Summary Models of political decision making often assume that politicians are fully informed on voters' preferences. Still, while they may be privileged witnesses of the democratic process, real-world politicians typically act upon imperfect information. Using a large scale survey among (498) Belgian local politicians we analyse whether and to what extent politicians are informed on public opinion. More precisely, we analyse their predictions of the electoral result of their own party in an upcoming election. The focus is on the impact of the electorate's complexity on this prediction accuracy. Complexity is defined in terms of the size and heterogeneity of the electorate. Complexity is found to affect both cognitive (prediction accuracy becomes smaller) and affective (predictions are biased through wishful thinking) processes underlying the politician's prediction. The empirical results show that smaller electorates have better informed politicians (with smaller prediction errors and less subject to wishful thinking), offering a case for decentralized government. Heterogeneity has a bearing on prediction accuracy and wishful thinking. Interestingly, the effects differ between politicians in power and those in opposition.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to review the theoretical limitations of single dimensional approaches for measuring inequality and to prove the effectiveness and practicality of the concept of “multidimensional inequality” by analyzing the inequality embedded in Korean society. This study constitutes nine dimensions of inequality (income, education, health, employment, social capital, leisure, work‐family reconciliation, housing, and social security) and analyzes inequality through the lens of each dimension by using data from of the first to fifth wave of the Korea Welfare Panel Study. The findings show a high degree of correlation among the dimensions of income, education, health, and social capital. However, work‐family reconciliation and housing have a relatively low correlation with income and the other dimensions. Second, multidimensional disparities were found between the groups of gender, age, and region. In conclusion, this study found a high degree of overlap between the concepts of income‐oriented inequalities and the multidimensional inequality approach. By capturing the notions of the multidimensional disparities that exist in each of the different groups, this study confirmed the effectiveness of multidimensional inequality as a useful concept for informing the creation of social policy intervention to alleviate inequality. },

abstract = {This paper explores the empirical application of theoretical multidimensional inequality analysis using real household welfare distributions. The paper operationalises recent conceptual developments in multidimensional inequality theory and assesses their usefulness for measurement and policy analysis. Despite the existence of a thriving theoretical literature on multidimensional inequality, empirical applications, particularly at the individual and household levels, are few and far between. This paper compares and contrasts different methodologies for the analysis of multidimensional welfare, including multidimensional inequality indices and stochastic dominance techniques. The results strongly highlight the importance of bringing non-monetary aspects of household welfare into the forefront of inequality analysis since measurements based solely on the distribution of income variables may misrepresent the degree of overall inequality in society. Agreement over the various approaches to the measurement of multidimensional inequality entails, however, non-trivial decisions that may limit the practical usefulness of these measures. We suggest that the use of multidimensional inequality ranges and restrictive dominance criteria may open significant scope for further developments in the empirical analysis of multidimensional inequality. },

abstract = {Standard models of labor migration suggest that migration is induced by real income differentials across locations and will, ceteris paribus, serve to reduce those differentials. And yet there is evidence that growing spatial inequality may co-exist with increased migration from poorer to richer areas, at least over certain ranges. At a theoretical level, this raises the question of modeling opposing forces, for convergence and divergence, in a common framework, and identifying the precise conditions under which the tendency for convergence dominates, or is dominated by, the forces for divergence. A conventional route to introducing forces for divergence is to bring agglomeration effects into the standard setup. This paper explores an alternative route, based on a theoretical and empirical proposition of the migration literature, namely, that migration is a selective process. Focusing on skilled migration, the paper demonstrates the different forces in play that make selective migration a force for both divergence and convergence, and characterizes where each set of forces dominates. Finally, it explores the consequences for convergence of combining migration selectivity and agglomeration effects arising from migrant networks.},

abstract = {Economic inequality has long been considered an important determinant of crime. Existing evidence, however, is mostly based on inadequately aggregated data sets, making its interpretation less than straightforward. Using tract- and county-level U.S. Census panel data, I decompose county-level income inequality into its within- and across-tract components and examine the extent to which county-level crime rates are influenced by local inequality and economic segregation. I find that the previously reported positive correlation between violent crime and economic inequality is largely driven by economic segregation across neighborhoods instead of within-neighborhood inequality. Moreover, there is little evidence of a significant empirical link between overall inequality and crime when county- and time-fixed effects are controlled for. On the other hand, a particular form of economic inequality, namely, poverty concentration, remains an important predictor of county-level crime rates. },

abstract = {Spatial effects have been recognized to play an important role in transitional dynamics of regional incomes. Detection and evaluation of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in discrete Markov chain models, which have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence, are vital, but under-explored issues. Indeed, in this spatiotemporal setting, spatial effects can take much more complex forms than that in a pure cross-sectional setting. In this paper, we address two test frameworks. The first is a conditional spatial Markov chains test framework, which can be used to detect spatial heterogeneity and temporally lagged spatial dependence; the second is a joint spatial Markov chains test framework, which tests for contemporaneous spatial dependence. A series of Monte Carlo experiments are designed to examine size, power and robustness properties of these tests for a range of sample sizes (spatial {\$}{\$}$\backslash$times {\$}{\$} × temporal dimensions), for different levels of discretization granularity and for different number of regimes. Results indicate that all tests display good size property except when sample size is fairly small. All tests for spatial dependence are similar in almost all aspects—size, power and robustness. Conditional spatial Markov tests for spatial heterogeneity have highest power for detecting spatial heterogeneity. Granularity of discretization has a major impact on the size properties of the tests when sample size is fairly small.},

abstract = {This book presents the underlying theory, model development, and applications of network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in a systematic way. The field of network DEA extends and complements conventional DEA by considering not only inputs and outputs when measuring system efficiency, but also the internal structure of the system being analyzed. By analyzing the efficiency of individual internal components, and more particularly by studying the effects of relationships among components which are modeled and implemented by means of various network structures, the “network DEA” approach is able to help identify and manage the specific components that contribute inefficiencies into the overall systems. This relatively new approach comprises an important analytical tool based on mathematical programming techniques, with valuable implications to production and operations management. The existing models for measuring the efficiency of systems of specific network structures are also discussed, and the relationships between the system and component efficiencies are explored. This book should be able to inspire new research and new applications based on the current state of the art. Performance evaluation is an important task in management, and is needed to (i) better understand the past accomplishments of an organization and (ii) plan for its future development. However, this task becomes rather challenging when multiple performance metrics are involved. DEA is a powerful tool to cope with such issues. For systems or operations composed of interrelated processes, managers need to know how the performances of the various processes evaluated and how they are aggregated to form the overall performance of the system. This book provides an advanced exposition on performance evaluation of systems with network structures. It explores the network nature of most production and operation systems, and explains why network analyses are necessary. },

abstract = {We explore the relationship between natural disasters and income inequality in Sri Lanka as the first study of this nature for the country. The analysis uses a unique panel data set constructed for the purpose of this paper. It contains district inequality measures based on household income reported in six waves of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Sri Lanka during the period between 1990 and 2013, data on disaster affected population and other economic and social indicators. Employing a panel fixed effects estimator, we find that contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly and substantially decrease inequality in per adult equivalent household income as measured by the Theil index. Findings are robust across various inequality metrics, sub-samples and alternative estimators such as Ordinary Least Squares and System GMM. However, natural disasters do not affect household expenditure inequality. Either households behave as if they have a permanent income or all households reduce their expenditure proportionately irrespective of their income level in responding to natural disasters. Natural disasters decrease non-seasonal agricultural and non-agricultural income inequality but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality. Income of richer households is mainly derived from non-agricultural sources such as manufacturing and business activities and non-seasonal agricultural activities. Poorer households have a higher share of agricultural income.},

What is known about the extent of international technology diffusion and the channels through which technology is spread is surveyed. Some of the major channels for technology diffusion across countries may include international trade and foreign direct investment. Despite the global reach of computer programs, there is not indication that a global pool of technology yet exists. Before discussing some of the evidence in more detail, a conceptual framework is presented that will guide this discussion. The following sections review various measures of technology and technology diffusion, then the pros and cons of a number of empirical approaches that have been employed are discussed. The overall evidence on international technology diffusion is summarized, and a synthesis and some suggestions for future work are presented.;},

This study intends to estimate the income-elasticities of healthcare expenditure in public and private sectors separately for investigating whether healthcare is a 'necessity' or 'luxury' for citizens of these countries. Panel data from 9 SEAR countries over 16 years (1995-2010) were employed. Fixed- and random-effect models were fitted to estimate income-elasticity of public, private and total healthcare expenditure. Results showed that one percent point increase in GDP per capita increased private expenditure on healthcare by 1.128{\%}, while public expenditure increased by only 0.412{\%}. Inclusion of three-year lagged variables of GDP per capita in the models did not have remarkable influence on the findings. The citizens of SEAR countries consider healthcare as a necessity while provided through public sector and a luxury when delivered by private sector. By increasing the public provisions of healthcare, more redistribution of healthcare resources can be ensured, which can accelerate the journey of SEAR countries towards universal health coverage.},

abstract = {When and why ethnic groups rebel remains a central puzzle in the civil war literature. In this paper, we examine how different types of inequalities affect both an ethnic group's willingness and opportunity to fight. We argue that political and economic inter-group inequalities motivate ethnic groups to initiate a fight against the state, and that intra-group economic inequality lowers their elite's costs of providing the necessary material and/or purposive incentives to overcome collective action problems inherent to rebel recruitment. We therefore predict that internally unequal ethnic groups excluded from power and/or significantly richer or poorer relative to the country's average are most likely to engage in a civil war. To assess our claim empirically, we develop a new global measure of economic inequality by combining high-resolution satellite images of light emissions, spatial population data, and geocoded ethnic settlement areas. After validating our measure at the country- and group level, we include it in a standard statistical model of civil war onset and find considerable support for our theoretical prediction: greater economic inequality within an ethnic group significantly increases the risk of conflict, especially if political or economic inequalities between groups provide a motive.},

abstract = {Police analysts are required to unravel the complexities in data to assist operational personnel in arresting offenders and directing crime prevention strategies. However, the volume of crime that is being committed and the awareness of modern criminals make this a daunting task. The ability to analyse this amount of data with its inherent complexities without using computational support puts a strain on human resources. This paper examines the current techniques that are used to predict crime and criminality. Over time, these techniques have been refined and have achieved limited success. They are concentrated into three categories: statistical methods, these mainly relate to the journey to crime, age of offending and offending behaviour; techniques using geographical information systems that identify crime hot spots, repeat victimisation, crime attractors and crime generators; a miscellaneous group which includes machine learning techniques to identify patterns in criminal behaviour and studies involving re-offending. The majority of current techniques involve the prediction of either a single offender's criminality or a single crime type's next offence. These results are of only limited use in practical policing. It is our contention that Knowledge Discovery in Databases should be used on all crime types together with offender data, as a whole, to predict crime and criminality within a small geographical area of a police force.},

It tests whether there is spatial dependence among cities on commodity housing price. The main influence factors of the housing price are further analyzed. Finally, the housing prices of the 8 cities are tested by the Granger. The results show that there is significant spatial dependence between cities on the housing price. The factors that affect the commodity housing price include spatial factor, urban residents' disposable income factor, population factor, land price factor and living space factor. Granger test shows that there is one-way relationship of Beijing to Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Shenyang, Changchun and Jinan. The conclusions establish the theoretical foundation for the formation mechanism of the housing price and offer references for engineering project pricing in real estate and government macro regulation.},

abstract = {Section 1.1 of this chapter introduces the concept of spatial dependence that often arises in cross-sectional spatial data samples. Spatial data samples rep­ resent observations that are associated with points or regions, for example homes, counties, states, or census tracts. Two motivational examples are pro­ vided for spatial dependence, one based on spatial spillovers stemming from congestion effects and a second that relies on omitted explanatory variables. Section 1.2 sets forth spatial autoregressive data generating processes for spa­ tially dependent sample data along with spatial weight matrices that play an important role in describing the structure of these processes. We provide more detailed discussion of spatial data generating processes and associated spatial econometric models in Chapter 2, and spatial weight matrices in Chapter 4. Our goal here is to provide an introduction to spatial autoregressive processes and spatial regression models that rely on this type of process. Section 1.3 provides a simple example of how congestion effects lead to spatial spillovers that impact neighboring regions using travel times to the central business district (CBD) region of a metropolitan area. Section 1.4 describes various scenarios in which spatial econometric models can be used to analyze spatial spillover effects. The final section of the chapter lays out the plan of this text. A brief enumeration of the topics covered in each chapter is provided},

Applying this integrated methodology, we investigate China's regional inequality at the county level using a comprehensive panel dataset that includes socioeconomic, environmental, locational, policy and GIS data from 1992 to 2010. The results show that Chinese regional inequality at the county level has a non-stationary dynamic structure, mirroring global inequality and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, the spatial panel data models analysis reveals the relative influence of explanatory variables. The impact of essential productive factors on regional development is gradually fading. Industrialization and decentralization play the most important role. The influence of marketization on regional development is not clear. The expansion of urban built-up areas has exerted a strong influence on the uneven regional development. Policy and transportation factor plays an indispensable role in regional inequality. The analysis additionally recognizes that socioeconomic factors play a dominant role, beyond policy and location factors. The role of environmental factors appears to be masked. This paper suggests that more attention needs to be paid to micro-inequality to coordinate inter-county and intra-county inequality under the pressure of rapid industrialization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture.

Applying this integrated methodology, we investigate China's regional inequality at the county level using a comprehensive panel dataset that includes socioeconomic, environmental, locational, policy, and GIS data from 1992 to 2010. The results show that Chinese regional inequality at the county level has a non-stationary dynamic structure, mirroring global inequality and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, the spatial panel data models analysis reveals the relative influence of explanatory variables. The impact of essential productive factors on regional development is gradually fading. Industrialization and decentralization play the most important role. The influence of marketization on regional development is not clear. The expansion of urban built-up areas has exerted a strong influence on the uneven regional development. Policy and transportation factor plays an indispensable role in regional inequality. The analysis additionally recognizes that socioeconomic factors play a dominant role, beyond policy and location factors. The role of environmental factors appears to be masked. This paper suggests that more attention needs to be paid to micro-inequality to coordinate inter-county and intra-county inequality under the pressure of rapid industrialization, urbanization, and modernization of agriculture.

abstract = {OLS may understate the effect of unemployment on crime because of the endogeneity problem (Raphael and Winter-Ember 2001). In this paper, we use changes in the real exchange rate, state manufacturing sector percentages, and state union membership rates as novel instrumental variables to carry out 2SLS estimations. We find a one-percentage-point increase in unemployment would increase property crime by 1.8 percent under the OLS method, but that the elasticity goes up to 4 percent under 2SLS. The larger 2SLS effect has significant policy implications because it explains 30 percent of the property crime change during the 1990s. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] },

The study implements Data Envelopment Analysis to calculate the efficiency score and understand if it is influenced by scale economies and determine the type of these economies. For this purpose, every municipality was modeled as a production function using 6 cost item inputs and 2 outputs. Finally, the study implemented a truncated regression equation using the bootstrapped efficiency estimate as the dependent variable, and a selection of indicators measuring the quality of public services offered in the context as the independent variables. Results reveal that there exist important scale inefficiencies in a number of municipalities, but unexpectedly a great amount of inefficiencies are caused by decreasing returns to scale. Additionally, the study suggests that a trade-off between expenditure efficiency and effectiveness, i.e. the quality of public service, seems to exist.},

abstract = {Chile has been cited as a successful case of development. Relatively fast economic growth over almost two decades has been accompanied by a significant reduction in absolute poverty. However, persistent economic growth and a mostly pro-poor structure of public expenditures have not been sufficient to reduce inequality in one of the most unequal countries in the world. We show that the key factors explaining this persistent inequality have been a low level of fiscal expenditures caused by low tax revenues that have not permitted enough public investment in human capital and knowledge generation and diffusion. },

abstract = {In times of economic crisis, most countries face the dual challenge of fighting unemployment while restraining social expenditures and closing budget deficits. The spending cuts and lack of employment affect a large number of decisions that have a direct or indirect impact on health. This impact is likely to be unevenly distributed among different groups within the population, and therefore not only health levels may be at risk, but also their distribution. The main purpose of this paper is to explore links between unemployment, economic growth, inequality, and health. We regress a measure of health, the Health Human Development Index (HHDI), against a set of explanatory variables accounting for the countries' economic performance (GDP growth, unemployment, and income inequality), and some institutional factors related to welfare spending and the nature of the health systems for the past three decades. In addition, we explore the causes for different results obtained using an inequality-adjusted HHDI, vs. the unadjusted HHDI. We describe a panel data model, estimated by random effects, for 32 countries from 1980-2010, in five-year intervals. Our conclusion is that the high economic growth observed in the last decades, together with an increase in the levels of income inequality and/or poverty, explain the observed changes of our index, particularly when this indicator is weighted by health inequality. The remaining institutional variables (the share of social spending, health care expenditure, and the type of health systems) show the expected sign but are not statistically significant. A comment on the methodological pitfalls of the approach completes the analysis.},

abstract = {The paper investigates factors that determine the average income growth and net migration rates in Swedish municipalities during 1981-99. The main issue is to test the hypothesis that conditional on a set of other possible determinants of regional growth, the growth rate in one municipality is affected by the growth rates in its neighbouring municipalities. The hypothesis of conditional convergence is also tested. A positive correlation is found between net migration rates in neighbouring municipalities, which suggests that net migration tends to 'spillover' to neighbouring municipalities. When it comes to average income growth, the results indicate spatial dependence in the error terms during the 1980s. However, there is no clear evidence in favour of the hypothesis of conditional convergence. Instead, the results predict conditional divergence between municipalities located in the Stockholm region throughout the period and also for municipalities outside the Stockholm region during the 1990s.},

Empirical results suggest that the real gross state product, the unemployment rate, the number of beds in community hospitals, the urbanization degree and the percentage of the population with at least the junior high school degree had a direct impact on the real health care outlay. Furthermore, the income elasticity is below the unity (0.83-0.88 according to the static panel estimates, 0.43-0.48 for the dynamic methods), implying that health expenditure is a necessity rather than a luxury good at the state level.},

However, local government as a sphere in the country is notorious for its spending inefficiency, which is cited as a major factor in service delivery failure. This paper quantifies inefficient expenditure at the local government level by estimating efficiency scores for a sample of 129 municipalities in South Africa from the 2005/2006 to the 2009/2010 municipal financial years. In essence, this paper examines the technical efficiency of municipalities by using the nonparametric free disposable hull approach and finds that 10 municipalities are constantly efficient over the period. On average, input efficiency scores range from 42{\%} to 46{\%}, suggesting that, in general, municipalities can achieve the same output levels with over 50{\%} less resources. Quantitatively for the 2009/2010 financial year, this amounts to a total of R80 billion being spent inefficiently, which equates to R220 million being “wasted” per day. },

abstract = {It has been widely believed that resource abundant economies grow less than other economies. In a very influential paper, Sachs and Warner (1997), point out that there is a negative relationship between resource abundance and growth. Two important econometric problems are present in the traditional empirical literature: First, the result might depend on factors that are correlated with primary exports but that have been excluded from the regression. Second, total GDP includes the production in the resource sector that has been declining in the last 30 years. We correct for those issues. Our results indicate that the so called 'Natural Resource Curse' might be related to a debt overhang. In the 70's when commodities' prices were high, natural resource abundant countries used them as collateral for debt. The 80's witnessed an important fall in the prices that drove these countries to debt crises. When we estimate the model taking these into account, we found that the effect of resource abundance disappears.},

In contrast, ordinary least squares is a consistent estimator, and, if White's [White, H., 1980. A heteroskedastic-consistent covariance matrix and a direct test for heteroskedasticity.

abstract = {This paper addresses the complex relationship between social inequality and urban conflict by offering a systematic and comprehensive approach to the articulation between macro structural inequality (density, segregation, concentration of high-income), meso level symbolic inequality (territorial stigma) and micro level experiences of conflict and place attachment. We contend that micro-social, neighbourhood level conflicts -mistakenly understood as ‘neighbourhood nuisances' (e.g. noise, odours, parking)- are associated with larger scale urban conflicts. We also argue that the development of affective ties with the neighbourhood in which they reside can insulate people from neighbourhood conflict, as well as helping to lessen the impact structural inequality and stigmatisation. Drawing on the results of a representative survey of 2300 individuals, carried out in Chile's capital city, Santiago, at the behest of the country's Ministry of Justice, we apply multilevel logistical regression models. The results obtained allow us to question the prevailing view that regards neighbourhood conflicts as essentially superficial and localised. Our results show that the incidence of these ‘nuisances' is not solely associated with individual socioeconomic circumstances, suggesting that they rather form part of a common framework of intersectional vulnerabilities. We suggest that suitable responses include the promotion of active forms of interconnectedness, which empower actors and challenge the noxious effects of the neoliberal model of development.},

abstract = {This research provides insight into the impact of natural disasters as drivers of rural to urban migration in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Disasters of varying types are predicted to have differing impacts on the productive sectors of agriculture, industry, and services, which due to the concentration of the various productive sectors in either urban or rural areas, subsequently changes the urban-rural wage differential. Changes to the wage differential (as measured by the urban-rural income gap) are predicted to lead to movement between urban and rural areas until a new equilibrium wage is reached. This dissertation first identifies a cut-off point for “large” disasters, where large is defined as having a substantial negative impact on the growth in GDP. The next question investigates whether the type of disaster economically impacts the sectors of agriculture, industry, and services in varying degrees. The third question examines changes to the urban-rural income gap in LAC countries as a result of the type of disaster. The final question analyzes rural to urban migration post-disaster in LAC countries. These macroeconomic analyses are conducted at the country-level using a fixed effects regression estimator. Droughts, floods, storms, and wildfires negatively affect the growth in agricultural output in LAC countries, while industry is negatively affected by earthquakes. Floods, landslides, and wildfires are also inversely associated with output in industry. Earthquakes are associated with decreases in output in the service sector, while floods are associated with increases. Droughts and wildfires are associated with a decline in the relative position of rural incomes when compared to urban. Earthquakes are associated with a decrease in the relative strength of urban incomes when compared to rural. The urban-rural income gap is most likely a moderating factor between disasters and migration. Migration peaks one to two years after a disaster. This dissertation concludes that there is support for the hypothesis that different types of disasters have differing impacts on the sectors of production, which in turn leads to changes in the urban-rural income gap, which subsequently plays a role in rural to urban migration. },

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Robert Putnam comprehensively analyzes the multidimensional nature of social capital and makes a persuasive argument for its relevance to various community social problems, including violent crime. However, systematic empirical evaluations of the links between the multiple dimensions of social capital and violence are limited by the lack of adequate measures. Using data from the Social Capital Benchmark Survey, the authors model the relationships between several dimensions of social capital and homicide rates for 40 U.S. geographic areas. Their findings show that many forms of social capital highlighted in the literature as having beneficial consequences for communities are not related to homicide rates. Two dimensions of social capital, social trust and social activism, do exhibit significant associations with homicide rates, net of other influences. However, in the latter case, the relationship is positive, and in both cases, simultaneous equation models suggest that these dimensions of social capital are consequences as well as causes of homicide. The results underscore the importance of examining the different dimensions of social capital and assessing their reciprocal relationships with homicide and other social outcomes. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

abstract = {Posted offer and double auction pricing institutions are examples of fixed and flexible pricing institutions, respectively. In laboratory settings, double auction markets dominate posted offer institutions in terms of the amount of potential surplus which traders are able to extract. These results are invariant with respect to the experience of traders or the perishability of the good traded. Performance differences across institutions may be due to information differences. The introduction of a second price-posting in the posted offer institution results in a pricing institution which is closer to the double auction's flexible pricing environment. Laboratory results suggest that under otherwise comparable conditions, this innovation is sufficient to remove the performance differences which have been demonstrated to exist between the posted offer and double auction institutions.},

Accordingly, the paper examines the trends, levels, sources and factors of income inequality in India between 2005 and 2012. Three important results stemmed from our analysis. First, in this paper we use Gini as a measure of inequality and find that income inequality in rural India has increased from 0.50 to 0.54 between 2005 and 2012, whereas, in urban India income inequality has increased from 0.48 to 0.49 during the same period. Next and most importantly, we decompose income inequality by income sources and find that amongst different sources of income inequality; the contribution of farm income in total inequality has decreased from 35 percent in 2005 to 21 percent in 2012 in rural India. On the other hand, the contribution of salaried income in total inequality has plummeted drastically from 65 percent in 2005 to 16 percent in 2012 in urban India. Finally, we use Theil's T index from the class of Generalized Entropy (GE) inequality measures, while decomposing income by four most important factors; namely, place of residence, social, educational and occupational groups. It is irrespective of these factors; the relative share of within-group inequality is not only much higher than that of between-group inequality, also its share has increased between these two periods. Thus, our paper suggests that these mutually reinforcing inequalities, in the long run, if not addressed effectively, will create a hard-hitting division between the privileged and the rest in Indian society.},

It is irrespective of these factors; the relative share of within-group inequality is not only much higher than that of between-group inequality, also its share has increased between these two periods. Thus, our paper suggests that these mutually reinforcing inequalities, in the long run, if not addressed effectively, will create a hard-hitting division between the privileged and the rest in Indian society.},

abstract = {The link between income inequality and governmental redistribution is still subject to intense research and debate. Starting with the median-voter-hypothesis, a plethora of theoretical models have been developed during the last three decades to identify and explain possible causal relationships. The empirical evidence so far, however, has been mixed. The aim of this paper is to review the existing literature on inequality and redistribution, to explicate the theoretical causal mechanisms identified so far, and to provide a comprehensive and rigorous empirical test that overcomes some of the shortcomings of previous empirical studies. Using panel data on 23 OECD countries over the time period of 1971-2005, we not only look at different spending categories but also at the share gains of different income deciles and the median-to-mean ratio. We find robust evidence that income inequality affects redistribution. However, the precise degree of this relationship differs for different parts of the income distribution.

Complex fitting modelling; the study of variables such as the audit impact on business failure; the treatment of traditional variables and ratios have led us to determine a starting point based on a reference mathematical model. In this regard, we have restricted the field of study to non-financial galician SMEs in order to develop a model11De Llano et al. (2011, 2010), Pi{\~{n}}eiro et al. (2010). to diagnose and forecast business failure. We have developed models based on relevant financial variables from the perspective of the financial logic, voltage and financial failure, applying three methods of analysis: discriminant, logit and multivariate linear. Finally, we have closed the first cycle using mathematical programming –DEA or Data Envelopment Analysis– to support the failure forecast. The simultaneous use of models was intended to compare their respective conclusions and to look for inter-relations. We can say that the resulting models are satisfactory on the basis of their capacity for prediction. Nevertheless, DEA contains significant points of criticism regarding its applicability to business failure.

abstract = {This paper assesses the technical efficiency of 231 local municipalities in South Africa for 2007 and investigates the potential determinants of efficiency gaps using the non-parametric data envelopment analysis technique. Efficiency scores are explained in a second-stage regression model using a Tobit regression model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt, using such a technique, to assess technical efficiency at the local government level in the African context. The results show that, on average, B1 and B3 municipalities could have theoretically achieved the same level of basic services with about 16{\%} and 80{\%} fewer resources respectively. Furthermore, fiscal autonomy and the number and skill levels of the top management of a municipality's administration were found to influence the productive efficiency of municipalities in South Africa. Perhaps most importantly, the results depict a bleak picture of the democratic behaviour at the local level in South Africa. It appears that higher income and highly educated households do not feel the incentive to be active participants in public decision-making processes. The paper findings raise concerns over the future of local municipalities in the country, especially about their capability to efficiently deliver expected outcomes on a sustainable basis. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in cross-sectional variations in municipality mental health expenditure. However, empirical work to date has not examined the links between such variability and demand and supply factors, particularly in the spatial domain. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The aim is to examine whether a local authority's spending decisions in the mental health field respond to neighbouring expenditure decisions. We explore a number of reasons why there might be interdependence between local authorities' decisions, labelling them the demonstrative, market leader, contextual, directive, shared resource and inducement effects. METHODS: Exploratory techniques from spatial data analysis are used to test for the existence of spatial structure. Drawing hypotheses from these initial exploratory analyses, we then adopt a reduced form demand and supply model, extended to incorporate possible policy interaction. The analysis of expenditure and cost variations has traditionally been based on regression models under the classical assumption that the observations are independent. But omitting the recognition that observations are interdependent might lead to erroneous statistical conclusions. Hence, we use spatial econometric techniques that explicitly take into account the potential interdependence of data in order to study the sources of spending variation between municipalities. RESULTS: The exploratory data analyses reveal the presence of positive significant spatial correlation. Per capita mental health spending distributes in clusters, with the highest concentrations in metropolitan areas such as Greater London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The estimated spatial regression models indicate that spatial autocorrelation characterises local expenditure decisions, consistent with some degree of policy interdependence between neighbouring municipalities. Comparing the results from our spatial model with those from a classical ('non-spatial') model suggests that the differences in the regression coefficients could be explained by the evident spatial pattern of the phenomenon, since the omission of the lagged dependent variable induces bias in the OLS estimates. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: These results help central and local decision makers understand the factors that influence local spending levels, including variations between municipalities in their achievement of expenditure-related and perhaps other performance targets. The actual patterns of spatial interaction may well be more complex than simple contiguity (the structure assumed here), but there seems little doubt that positive interdependence is an important feature of decision making. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Statistical interrogation of a panel dataset would allow exploration of both time-series and cross-municipality variation in mental health expenditure. Subsequent analysis would also benefit from more disaggregated data (e.g. at a census ward level) and the accompanying use of spatial multilevel techniques.},

abstract = {Using 1960–2012 annual time-series data for modelling, we apply the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Cointegration (ARDL) approach, to identify some major drivers of per capita real U.S. health spending. The ARDL Bounds testing procedure (Pesaran et al., 1999; 2001) has several econometric advantages compared with the standard Johansen and Juselius cointegration method. One distinguishing feature of this ARDL Bounds testing procedure is its ability to estimate the long-run economic relationship without requiring pre-testing the time-series for the presence of unit roots in the data generating process incorporated in the cointegration model. The empirical findings in this study indicate that per capita real income (INCOME), the population percent above 65 years (AGE) and the level of health care technology (HRD), measured as the level of Research {\&} Development expenditure in health care are cointegrated. INCOME, AGE and HRD exert positive effects on U.S. health expenditure per capita. Unlike prior studies, this paper presents new empirical evidence indicating that the U.S. health care is a necessity, with an income elasticity estimate of around 0.92. We also find that medical technology advances play a major role in the long run rise of the U.S. health expenditure. We discuss implications of these findings.},

This paper is the second of two. It covers the aspects related to local governments' efficiency measurement along with its determinants, that is, taking into account the effect of environmental variables over efficiency. First, we describe which techniques have been used to incorporate environmental variables in the context of local governments. Second, we provide a classification for the determinants used and summarize their impact on efficiency. Finally, we discuss some operative directions and considerations for further research in the field. },

abstract = {Abstract The increase in economic disparities over the past 30 years has prompted extensive research on the causes and consequences of inequality both in the United States and, more recently, globally. This review provides an update of research on the patterns and causes of economic inequality in the United States, including inequality of earnings, wealth, and opportunity. We also explore the social and political consequences of inequality, particularly in the areas of health, education, crime, social capital, and political power. Finally, we spotlight an emerging literature on world inequality, which examines inequality trends within as well as across nations. Sociologists can advance research on inequality by bringing discipline-based expertise to bear on the organization and political economy of firms and labor markets, the pathways through which inequality has an effect, and the social, political, and cultural contingencies that might modify this effect.},

Does it follow that the limited availability of natural resources will at some time in the future constrain economic growth as many environmentalists believe? While classical economists have shared the belief in limits to growth, the distinctive feature of modern neoclassical economics is its optimism about the availability of natural resources. This survey suggests that resource optimism can be summarised in four propositions. First, a rise in the price of a resource leads to a substitution of this resource with another more abundant resource and to a substitution of products that are intensive in this resource. Second, a rise in the price of a resource leads to increased recycling of the resource and to the exploration and extraction of lower quality ores. Third, man-made capital can substitute for natural resources. Fourth, technical progress increases the efficiency of resource use and makes extraction of lower quality ores economical. In a critical analysis of these four propositions it is shown that while the conjecture that natural resources will never constrain future economic growth is logically conceivable, we do not and indeed cannot know whether it will be possible in practice to overcome any resource constraint.

abstract = {Despite a broad theoretical literature on multidimensional inequality and a widespread belief that welfare is not synonymous to income--not the least in a developing context--empirical inequality examinations rarely includes several welfare attributes. We explore three techniques on how to evaluate multidimensional inequality using Zambian household data on consumption, education, health and land. The examination indicates that level and changes in non-monetary inequality are at odds with consumption inequality. Moreover, assessment of a multidimensional index shows evidence of that dimensions of wellbeing compensate and reinforce each other with respect to inequality. However, a majority of the results using this technique are sensitive to the degree of substitution between attributes. In applying a stochastic dominance method few combinations fulfill the required dominance conditions. Accordingly, less imposed structure come at a cost. Clearly, sensitivity analyzes, explicitness and analyzes involving more than one technique are constructive in portraying multidimensional inequality. },

abstract = {This paper provides evidence on the degree and patterns of intergenerational income and educational mobility in urban Chile. We find intergenerational income elasticities for Greater Santiago in Chile in the range of 0.52 to 0.54. This is lower than recent nation-wide elasticities for Chile of about 0.6-0.7, but still stands as fairly high in comparison with the comparable international evidence. We also find that intergenerational educational mobility is lower for the younger cohorts, which however does not necessarily imply an increase of intergenerational educational mobility in the last decades, as life-cycle effects may be at work. Finally, we find evidence of a higher degree of intergenerational persistence of income at the two extremes of the income distribution, which is more accentuated at the top centiles of the distribution.

abstract = {This paper evaluates the economic reform process in Latin America and how it affected economic and social outcomes. It is based on wide-ranging research undertaken by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years; a useful starting point to that research is ECLAC.;This paper argues that Latin America's market-oriented reforms, together with increased monetary and fiscal discipline, were successful in bringing down inflation, inducing export growth and diversification, and attracting foreign direct investment. Nonetheless, economic growth was frustratingly slow. Pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies generated, in turn, strong business cycles in the face of unstable access to international capital markets. Higher productivity in leading firms and sectors failed to spread throughout the economy and led to increasing productive sector dualism. Furthermore, despite the democratic dividend reflected in increased social spending and coverage of social services, weak economic performance and additional distributive tensions led to disappointing results in terms of employment generation and poverty reduction. Overcoming these frustrating outcomes would require counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies, open-economy productive development strategies and mainstreaming social objectives into economic policies.;This paper argues that Latin America's market-oriented reforms, together with increased monetary and fiscal discipline, were successful in bringing down inflation, inducing export growth and diversification, and attracting foreign direct investment.

abstract = {  In an interview, Jose Antonio Ocampo, Professor, Columbia University, talked about the broader impact of the fall in commodity prices on Latin American economies. He said his analysis of the Latin American boom of the last decade was based on the idea that all of the external factors were favorable. Latin America had high levels of remittances, exceptionally good external financing, booming international trade, and, as you rightly mentioned, booming commodity prices. The global financial crisis caused these prices to fall dramatically, but they recovered quickly thanks to rampant Chinese demand for raw materials. The question for the next decade and onward will be whether China will be able to sustain demand and Latin American commodity prices. This is a giant question mark for not only Latin America but also the entire developing world because commodity prices can be a very good engine of growth for developing countries.},

Less developed regions are often seen as a drag on national performance, rather than as potential assets to be exploited. In the past, most policies aimed at supporting such regions sought to “prop them up” through fiscal transfers and subsidies, an approach that yielded very poor results. However, a new OECD report, Promoting Growth in All Regions, provides fresh analysis that shows how relatively backward regions can in fact be potentially important sources of growth, but that a very different approach is needed to tap that potential.},

abstract = {Using data on 48 contiguous U.S. states and a spatial econometric approach, this paper examines short- and long-run effects of productive higher education and highway infrastructure spending financed by different revenue sources on state economic growth. Following the Lagrange Multiplier, Wald, and Likelihood Ratio tests, the data are found to be characterized by both spatial lag and spatial error processes, leading to the estimation of a dynamic spatial Durbin model. By decomposing results of the dynamic spatial Durbin model into short- and long-run direct as well as indirect (spillover) effects, we show that accounting for spillover effects provides a more comprehensive approach to uncovering the effects of productive government spending on growth. We find that, regardless of the financing source, productive higher education and highway spending have statistically significant short- and long-run direct as well as spillover effects on state income growth.},

Robust Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and regression analysis were conducted using data for 47 developing countries for the periods 2000--2004, 2005--2009, and 2010--2012. The estimations show that countries with a more equal income distribution and better government effectiveness (i.e. a more competent bureaucracy and good quality public service delivery) may need fewer health inputs to achieve a specific level of the U5SR than other countries with higher inequality and worse government effectiveness.},

abstract = {This article introduces the use of regression models based on the Poissondistribution as a tool for resolving common problems in analyzing aggregatecrime rates. When the population size of an aggregate unit is small relativeto the offense rate, crime rates must be computed from a small number ofoffenses. Such data are ill-suited to least-squares analysis. Poisson-basedregression models of counts of offenses are preferable because they arebuilt on assumptions about error distributions that are consistent withthe nature of event counts. A simple elaboration transforms the Poissonmodel of offense counts to a model of per capita offense rates. Todemonstrate the use and advantages of this method, this article presentsanalyses of juvenile arrest rates for robbery in 264 nonmetropolitancounties in four states. The negative binomial variant of Poisson regressioneffectively resolved difficulties that arise in ordinary least-squaresanalyses. },

abstract = {Previous empirical works on municipal efficiency have mostly used cross-sectional data which makes it impossible to separate unobserved heterogeneity from inefficiency. Furthermore, they have also typically used a two stages approach which has been widely criticized as the assumptions made in the first stage are violated in the second stage, generating biased results. We present one of the first longitudinal parametric studies that analyze municipal efficiency and its determinants using a one step procedure. Furthermore, we are the first of this kind that analize overall efficiency as well as efficiency by clusters of municipalities in order to reduce heterogeneity. We use administrative datasets of Chilean municipalities for the 2008-2010 period and our results suggest that Chilean municipalities have on average an inefficiency level of 30{\%} with a significant variance between clusters of municipalities. Also, our results suggest that socio-economic, fiscal and political variables affect municipal efficiency. In particular, we found that municipalities with tighter budget constraints are associated with more efficient municipalities. },

abstract = {The paper analyses the impact of domestic and international tourism on the economic growth process for 179 E uropean regions. The econometric analysis is based on a spatial growth regression framework where the rate of GDP   per capita growth at the regional level for the period 1999–2009 depends on tourism flows, in addition to the traditional growth variables.

The so-called absolute convergence hypothesis focuses on initial income levels to account for the variability in income growth among regions. Empirical data seem to support the absolute convergence hypothesis for US states, but the data also show that natural resource abundance is a significant negative determinant of growth. We find that natural resource abundance decreases investment, schooling, openness, and R{\&}D expenditure and increases corruption, and we show that these effects can fully explain the negative effect of natural resource abundance on growth. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It is well known that a strong relationship exists between national expenditures on health care and national income. This has been used to suggest that health care is a luxury good, and that factors such as the type of health care delivery system in a country are of little importance in determining expenditure levels. This paper argues that these implications rely upon the application of microeconomic analysis to macroeconomic data, and that this is not appropriate. As well as raising questions about the inferences drawn from previous studies, new empirical evidence is presented which casts some doubts on previous findings. International comparisons are based on Purchasing Power Parity rather than exchange rate conversions, underlining the importance of prices as well as quantities in the relationship, and leading to the conclusion that the aggregate data show health care to be, if anything, a necessity rather than a luxury good.},

We perform simple but informative decompositions to figure out the contributing factors behind that dissimilarity in the behavior of inequality across those two subperiods. Our results are consistent with a story in which economic growth increases the demand for more educated workers, initially increasing inequality. However, those higher returns to education encourage agents to invest in higher education, producing a subsequent human capital deepening that reduces inequality at later stages of the development process.},

A conditional convergence growth model is considered where the growth of per capita income depends on inequality and other growth factors. The contribution of each province to the overall inequality obtained from the Theil index is considered. Results indicate that inequality has a positive and significant effect on per capita income growth. However, the magnitude of the inequality effect is not stable across regions. Geographically Weighted Regression estimates show that the magnitude of the inequality growth relationship varies over a range of 0.72 to 3.36. Other results are also noteworthy in this study. Per capita income grows faster in provinces that contribute more to the overall inequality. Provinces with higher poverty incidence tend to grow less and human capital appears to be a significant booster to per capita income growth. Additionally, urban provinces tend to grow faster than the rural ones.},

abstract = {Purpose - By utilizing the two most commonly used approaches to generate "best practice frontier" to estimate efficiency of observed units, the purpose of this research paper is to estimate technical efficiency for total population of 200 Slovenian municipalities for the 2011 fiscal year. Design/methodology/approach - Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods are used to estimate technical efficiency levels. Namely, the majority of studies have utilized these two "traditional" approaches. Since the advantages of one method often represent the disadvantages of the other method, the two methods have been selected to compare the results obtained on the technical efficiency levels. Findings - The results suggest that mean technical inefficiency should be approximately 22-25 percent (SFA method), whereas DEA method suggests the inefficiency in the range 12-18 percent. The DEA approach also suggests that the paper has many more technically efficient units compared to the SFA estimates. Nevertheless, the SFA assessment has revealed that, although on average the inefficiency should be larger compared to the DEA assessment, more than one-third of municipalities should exhibit relatively low levels of inefficiency (less than 5 percent). Originality/value - This study utilizes both parametric as well as non-parametric approaches to assess the technical efficiency, which is not very common in the empirical literature. Besides, it focusses on the local government efficiency in a post-socialist country. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

It features writings from international contributors who specialize in digital art and performance practices.;The main driver of inequality--returns on capital that exceed the rate of economic growth--is again threatening to generate extreme discontent and undermine democratic values.

Thomas Piketty's findings in this ambitious, original, rigorous work will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.;Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns and shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities. He argues, however, that the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth will generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values if political action is not taken. What are the grand dynamics that drive the accumulation and distribution of capital? Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In this work the author analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality. He shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality, the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth, today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values if political action is not taken. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, the author says, and may do so again.

abstract = {  This paper summarizes the main findings and perspectives emerging from a collective research project on the dynamics of income and wealth distribution. The primary objective is to construct a high-quality, long-run, international database on income and wealth concentration, using historical tax statistics. In this database, the data are annual, long-run time series; they are fairly homogenous across countries; and they are also broken down by income source. Hence they offer a unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of income and wealth distribution and the interplay between inequality and growth.},

Cross-section analysis in combination with a Bayesian Modeling Averaging strategy supports the convergence hypothesis, despite of some instability detected in the estimated speed of convergence. When applying time-series based tests, the no convergence null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the usual significance levels. When clustering the Chilean regions into three different groups, however, evidence of cointegration within these groups is found, indicating that the regional growth process in Chile is driven by a lower number of common trends.},

abstract = {[In data envelopment analysis (DEA), the use of constant returns-to-scale (CRS) models requires the assumption of full proportionality between all inputs and outputs. Often such proportionality cannot be assumed, although there may be a subset of outputs proportional to a subset of inputs. By using the variable returns-to-scale (VRS) model, this information is effectively ignored and the efficiency of units is overestimated. This paper develops a hybrid approach that combines the assumption of CRS with respect to the selected sets of inputs and outputs, while preserving the VRS assumption with respect to the remaining indicators.

abstract = {This paper proposes data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a quick-and-easy tool for assessing corporate bankruptcy. DEA is a non-parametric method that measures weight estimates (not parameter estimates) of a classification function for separating default and non-default firms. Using a recent sample of large corporate failures in the United States, we examine the capability of DEA in assessing corporate bankruptcy by comparing it with logistic regression (LR). We find that DEA outperforms LR in evaluating bankruptcy out-of-sample. This feature of DEA is appealing and has practical relevance for investors. Another advantage of DEA over LR is that it does not have assumptions associated with statistical and econometric methods. Furthermore, DEA does not need a large sample size for bankruptcy evaluation, usually required by such statistical and econometric approaches. The need for such a large sample size is a significant disadvantage to practitioners when investment decisions are made using small samples. DEA can bypass such a difficulty related to a sample size. Thus, DEA is a practically appealing method for bankruptcy assessment.},

The proposed approach is applied to a random sample of 1001 firms, which is composed of 50 large US bankrupt firms randomly selected from Altman's bankruptcy database and 901 healthy matching firms. This sample represents the largest firms that went bankrupt over the period 1991–2004 and represents a full spectrum of industries. Our findings demonstrate that the DEA model is relatively weak in predicting corporate failures compared to healthy firm predictions, and the assessment index improves this weakness by giving the decision maker various options to achieve different precision levels of bankrupt, non-bankrupt, and total predictions.},

For these purposes, a two-stage methodology was applied, in which for the first time a fractional regression model (FRM) was employed in the second stage of analysis, so that, in the first stage a nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to analyze the efficiencies of tomato production and in the second stage, farm specific variables such as education level, farmers' age, total land size and use of manure were used in a fractional regression model to explain how these factors influenced efficiency of tomato farming. The results of the first stage showed that there are considerable differences between efficient and inefficient farmers in the studied area, so that the main differences were in the use of chemical fertilizers, biocides and water for irrigation. Also, the results of second stage revealed that farmers' age, education level and total land size positively affected efficiency in tomato production. So, better use of land, chemical fertilizers, water for irrigation and improving the farmers' educational levels through literacy campaign and land consolidation would probably increase the efficiency in the long term.},

Rajan shows how the individual choices that collectively brought about the economic meltdown--made by bankers, government officials, and ordinary homeowners--were rational responses to a flawed global financial order in which the incentives to take on risk are incredibly out of step with the dangers those risks pose. He traces the deepening fault lines in a world overly dependent on the indebted American consumer to power global economic growth and stave off global downturns. He exposes a system where America's growing inequality and thin social safety net create tremendous political pressure to encourage easy credit and keep job creation robust, no matter what the consequences to the economy's long-term health; and where the U.S. financial sector, with its skewed incentives, is the critical but unstable link between an overstimulated America and an underconsuming world.},

Often, in a second stage, a regression model is estimated to relate DEA efficiency scores to exogenous factors. In this paper, we argue that the traditional linear or tobit approaches to second-stage DEA analysis do not constitute a reasonable data-generating process for DEA scores. Under the assumption that DEA scores can be treated as descriptive measures of the relative performance of units in the sample, we show that using fractional regression models is the most natural way of modeling bounded, proportional response variables such as DEA scores. We also propose generalizations of these models and, given that DEA scores take frequently the value of unity, examine the use of two-part models in this framework. Several tests suitable for assessing the specification of each alternative model are also discussed.},

However, this is due to falling inequality between countries. Average inequality within developing countries has been slowly rising, though staying fairly flat since 2000. As a rule, higher rates of growth in average incomes have not put upward pressure on inequality within countries. Growth has generally helped reduce the incidence of absolute poverty, but less so in more unequal countries. High inequality also threatens to stall future progress against poverty by attenuating growth prospects. Perceptions of rising absolute gaps in living standards between the rich and the poor in growing economies are also consistent with the evidence.{\%}U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/344/6186/851.full.pdf},

abstract = {Discrete Markov chain models (DMCs) have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence. This popularity reflects the rich body of DMC theory on the one hand and the ability of this framework to provide insights on the internal and external properties of regional income distribution dynamics on the other. In this paper we examine the properties of tests for spatial effects in DMC models of regional distribution dynamics. We do so through a series of Monte Carlo simulations designed to examine the size, power and robustness of tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in transitional dynamics. This requires that we specify a data generating process for not only the null, but also alternatives when spatial heterogeneity or spatial dependence is present in the transitional dynamics. We are not aware of any work which has examined these types of data generating processes in the spatial distribution dynamics literature. Results indicate that tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence display good power for the presence of spatial effects. However, tests for spatial heterogeneity are not robust to the presence of strong spatial dependence, while tests for spatial dependence are sensitive to the spatial configuration of heterogeneity. When the spatial configuration can be considered random, dependence tests are robust to the dynamic spatial heterogeneity, but not so to the process mean heterogeneity when the difference in process means is large relative to the variance of the time series.},

An additive pairwise decomposition based on a spatial weights matrix partitions inequality between observations that are geographically neighbors and those that are not. A framework for inference on the spatial decomposition is also suggested. The statistical properties of the decomposition measure are evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation and an empirical illustration involving per capita income inequality in the US states is also provided.},

abstract = {This paper uses NUTS3 sub-regional data for Great Britain to analyse the determinants of spatial variations in income and productivity. We decompose the spatial variation of earnings into a productivity effect and an occupational composition effect. For the former (but not the latter) we find a robust relationship with proximity to economic mass, suggesting that doubling the population of working age proximate to an area is associated with a 3.5{\%} increase in productivity in the area. We measure proximity by travel time, and show that effects decline steeply with time, ceasing to be important beyond approximately 80??min. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Several aspects of the incivilities thesis, or the role of social and physical disorder in encouraging crime and fear, deserve further testing. These include examining individual- and streetblock-level impacts on reactions to crime and local commitment over time, and testing for lagged and co-occurring impacts at each level. We model these four types of impacts on three reactions to crime and community satisfaction using a panel study of residents (n = 305) on fifty streetblocks, interviewed two times a year apart. At the individual level, incivilities showed unambiguous, lagged impacts on satisfaction, fear, and worry; furthermore, changes in perceived incivilities accompanied changes in resident satisfaction and fear. At the streetblock level: incivilities failed to demonstrate expected lagged impacts on either of the two outcomes where data structures permitted such impacts; changing incivilities, however, were accomp-anied by changing community satisfaction and changing perceptions of relative risk. Before we conclude that lagged ecological impacts of incivilities are weaker than previous theorizing suggests, we must resolve some outstanding theoretical and methodological issues.},

This paper extends the literature by analyzing the effects that such correlation has. It will be shown that if the true technical efficiency is negatively correlated with the non-discretionary inputs, the existing DEA efficiency estimates will be biased upward. Using simulated data, the performance of the existing model will be analyzed. In addition, a corrected model will be introduced to effectively handle the problem. The resulting model is able to disentangle the two effects that the non-discretionary factor has on production. },

This paper shows that there is little direct evidence that omitted geographical or climate variables explain the curse, or that there is a bias resulting from some other unobserved growth deterrent.

In this paper we show that economies with a high ratio of natural resource exports to GDP in 1971 (the base year) tended to have low growth rates during the subsequent period 1971-89. This negative relationship holds true even after controlling for variables found to be important for economic growth, such as initial per capita income, trade policy, government efficiency, investment rates, and other variables. We explore the possible pathways for this negative relationship by studying the cross-country effects of resource endowments on trade policy, bureaucratic efficiency, and other determinants of growth. We also provide a simple theoretical model of endogenous growth that might help to explain the observed negative relationship.},

abstract = {Using data on earnings and productivity for U.S. manufacturing industries from 1971 to 2001, we investigate economic rents and rising income inequalities. The results suggest that rents are most significant for managers, professionals, middle-aged workers, and older workers. Conversely, negative rents are evident for women, Hispanics, single men, and blue-collar workers. The underpayment of Hispanics appears to have increased while African Americans have gone from being underpaid to being overpaid. Workers with a college degree have become overpaid (i.e., “credentialism”) while “gift-exchange” efficiency wages have declined. The marginal productivity of labor input has increased but is increasingly underpaid.},

abstract = {This study examines the structural determinants of robbery and homicide offending in 171 American cities with a population greater than 100,000 in 1980. A macro-level social control model is presented that focuses on the consequences for formal and informal social control of police aggressiveness, jail incarceration risk, state incarceration, and family structure. Controlling for known determinants of crime rates such as poverty, inequality, and racial composition, the general question posed is, Do variations in criminal justice sanctions and the structural arrangement of families influence criminal behavior? To disentangle possible confounding effects of city composition in terms of demographic attributes, crime rates were disaggregated by age, race, and sex of offender. At least three major conclusions emerged. First, local official sanctions appear to have significant deterrent effects on robbery offending: cities with a high risk of jail incarceration produce disproportionately low robbery rates regardless of both demographic attributes of offenders and other known determinants of criminality. Cities where the police make frequent arrests for public order offenses (e. g., disorderly conduct and driving under the influence) tend to have significantly lower rates of black adult robbery. In addition, cities located in states with a high risk of imprisonment tend to have lower rates of juvenile robbery offending. Second, the empirical results demonstrate the importance of family and marital disruption as determinants of both robbery and homicide. In general, cities with a high percentage of black and white households comprised of a married-couple family have low rates of black and white juvenile offending, respectively, while the divorce rate exhibits a strong positive effect on adult offending. Finally, the results confirm traditional sociological concerns with economic stratification, as cities characterized by racial income inequality, poverty, and low occupational status were shown to have significantly higher rates of robbery and homicide. },

abstract = {Shaw and McKay's influential theory of community social disorganization has never been directly tested. To address this, a community-level theory that builds on Shaw and McKay's original model is formulated and tested. The general hypothesis is that low economic status, ethnic heterogeneity, residential mobility, and family disruption lead to community social disorganization, which, in turn, increases crime and delinquency rates. A community's level of social organization is measured in terms of local friendship networks, control of street-corner teenage peer groups, and prevalence of organizational participation. The model is first tested by analyzing data for 238 localities in Great Britain constructed from a 1982 national survey of 10,905 residents. The model is then replicated on an independent national sample of 11,030 residents of 300 British localities in 1984. Results from both surveys support the theory and show that between-community variations in social disorganization transmit much of the effect of community structural characteristics on rates of both criminal victimization and criminal offending. },

abstract = {This article assesses the sources and consequences of public disorder. Based on the videotaping and systematic rating of more than 23,000 street segments in Chicago, highly reliable scales of social and physical disorder for 196 neighborhoods are constructed. Census data, police records, and an independent survey of more than 3,500 residents are then integrated to test a theory of collective efficacy and structural constraints. Defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space, collective efficacy explains lower rates of crime and observed disorder after controlling neighborhood structural characteristics. Collective efficacy is also linked to lower rates of violent crime after accounting for disorder and the reciprocal effects of violence. Contrary to the "broken windows" theory, however, the relationship between public disorder and crime is spurious except perhaps for robbery.},

This hypothesis was tested on a 1995 survey of 8782 residents of 343 neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. Multilevel analyses showed that a measure of collective efficacy yields a high between-neighborhood reliability and is negatively associated with variations in violence, when individual-level characteristics, measurement error, and prior violence are controlled. Associations of concentrated disadvantage and residential instability with violence are largely mediated by collective efficacy.},

In the 15 years since the theoretical introduction of the workplace incivility construct, research in this domain has taken off, albeit in a variety of directions. We review the extant body of research on workplace incivility and note the multitude of samples, sources, methodologies, and instrumentation used. In this review article, we provide an organized review of the extant body of work that encompasses three distinct types of incivility: experienced, witnessed, and instigated incivility. These three types of incivility serve as the foundation for a series of comprehensive models in which we integrate extant empirical research. In the last part of this review article, we suggest directions for future research that may contribute to this growing body of work. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. },

Whereas from a basic analysis of development accounting with crude data total factor productivity (TFP) emerges as a fundamental determinant, when more accurate data are used in the estimations of human and physical capital to take into account their quality, results change radically, showing a higher importance of factor accumulation with respect to previous standard estimations.

Cet article cherche a evaluer la contribution relative de l'accumulation de facteurs et de la technologie afin d'expliquer les ecarts de rendement par travailleur a travers les regions d'Italie. On estime separement la contribution des capitaux physique et humain par moyen de la variance decomposee du rendement par travailleur. Alors qu'a partir d'une analyse de base de la comptabilite de developpement, la TFP (productivite globale des facteurs) s'avere un determinant essentiel, quand on emploie des donnees plus justes pour estimer les capitaux humain et physique pour tenir compte de leur qualite, les resultats sont radicalement transformes, accordant une plus grande importance a l'accumulation de facteurs par rapport aux estimations standard anterieures.

In diesem Aufsatz wird der relative Beitrag der Faktorenakkumulation und Technologie zur Erklarung der Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen italienischen Regionen hinsichtlich der Leistung pro Arbeitnehmer untersucht. Die Beitrage des physischen und humanen Kapitals werden mit Hilfe einer Varianzdekomposition der Leistung pro Arbeitnehmer gesondert geschatzt. Bei einer Grundanalyse der Entwicklung mit Hilfe roher Daten erweist sich die Gesamtfaktorproduktivitat als fundamentaler Determinant. Werden jedoch genauere Daten zur Schatzung des humanen und physischen Kapitals herangezogen, um deren Qualitat zu berucksichtigen, andern sich die Ergebnisse radikal und weisen auf eine hohere Bedeutung der Faktorenakkumulation fur die fruheren Standardschatzungen hin.

En este documento se evalua la contribucion relativa de la acumulacion de factores y la tecnologia para explicar las diferencias de rendimiento por trabajador entre las regiones de Italia. Se calculan por separado las contribuciones del capital humano y fisico a traves de la descomposicion de varianza del rendimiento por trabajador. Mientras que, a partir de un analisis basico de desarrollo mediante datos brutos, la productividad total de los factores surge como un determinante fundamental, cuando se utilizan datos mas exactos en las estimaciones de capital humano y fisico para tener en cuenta su calidad, los resultados cambian radicalmente y muestran una mayor importancia de la acumulacion de factores con respecto a las estimaciones estandares anteriores.

More specifically, it examined the direct, indirect (spatial spillover), and total effects of such infrastructure on the output growth of the provinces. To this end, maximum likelihood was used to estimate a spatial Durbin model for the provinces over the period 2001 to 2011. The results showed that main road and railway transport frameworks exert a positive and significant direct effect on the economic growth of the provinces. The main road and railway transport infrastructure in each province has a significant and positive indirect effect on the economic growth of the other provinces, indicating that improvements to individual infrastructure have spatial spillover effects on the economic growth of the other provinces. The conclusion drawn from these findings is that diffusion effects overcome agglomeration effects. Finally, total railway length has a positive spatial spillover effect on regional economic growth.},

abstract = {"Japan was the first Asian country to become a mature industrial society, and throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, was viewed as an "all-middle-class society". However since the 1990s there have been growing doubts as to the real degree of social equality in Japan, particularly in the context of dramatic demographic shifts as the population ages whilst fertility levels continue to fall. This book compares Japan with America, Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Taiwan in order to determine whether inequality really is a social problem in Japan. With a focus on impact demographic shifts, Sawako Shirahase examines female labour market participation, income inequality among households with children, the state of the family, generational change, single person households and income distribution among the aged, and asks whether increasing inequality and is uniquely Japanese, or if it is a social problem common across all of the societies included in this study. Crucially, this book shows that Japan is distinctive not in terms of the degree of inequality in the society, but rather, in how acutely inequality is perceived. Further, the data shows that Japan differs from the other countries examined in terms of the gender gap in both the labour market and the family, and in inequality among single-person households - single men and women, including lifelong bachelors and spinsters - and also among single parent households, who pay a heavy price for having deviated from the expected pattern of life in Japan. Drawing on extensive empirical data, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars interested in Japanese culture and society, Japanese studies and social policy more generally"--},

abstract = {In this paper we study the political economy of the inter-regional allocation of investment in infrastructure, in an effort to disentangle tactical and programmatic motives, where tactical politics refers to the discretionary allocation of investment to districts with more ‘political clout' and programmatic politics refers to the allocation of investment according to certain ‘objective' criteria (e.g., income level). We use a panel of data from the Spanish electoral districts for the period 1964–2004 to estimate an equation in which investment depends both on economic and political variables. The results show that tactical politics do matter since the districts receiving the most funds are those in which: (i) the incumbent's vote margin is low, (ii) few votes are needed to win an additional seat in the legislature, (iii) the central and regional governments are controlled by the same party, and (iv) regional parties play a pivotal role in the legislature. However, the results also show that programmatic politics matter, since inter-regional redistribution is shown to increase: (i) with the arrival of democracy and European Union funds, (ii) under leftist governments, and (iii) the weaker the correlation is between ‘political clout' and regional income.},

abstract = {It is known (Hartwick and others) that, under standard assumptions, a society that invests in reproducible capital the competitive rents on its current extraction of exhaustible resources, will enjoy a consumption stream constant in time. It is shown here that this result can be interpreted as saying that an appropriately defined stock of capital -including the initial endowment of resources - is being maintained intact, and that consumption can be interpreted as the interest on that patrimony. This seems like a useful rule of thumb for policy.},

abstract = {ObjectiveNeighborhood disadvantage (ND), incivilities, and crime disproportionately impact minority women, discouraging physical activity (PA). Social support (SS) is a cultural tool promoting PA in minority women. Socially supportive environments may promote PA in disadvantaged neighborhoods, yet few studies have investigated the mediating role of social support among minority women. This study examined SS as a mediator among ND, incivilities, crime, and PA. MethodsThe Health Is Power study aimed to increase PA in African American and Hispanic Latina women (N=410) in Houston and Austin, TX. ND and crime data were taken from the National Neighborhood Crime Study. Incivilities were measured using the Pedestrian Environment Data Scan (PEDS). SS was measured using the Family and Friend Support for Exercise Habits scale and physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Linear regression analysis was used to examine SS as a mediator following the Baron and Kenny method. ResultsND was negatively associated with PA and SS. SS was not a mediator as it was not significantly associated with ND, crime, and incivilities (F(3,264)=2.02, p{\textgreater}.05) or PA (F(1,266)=3.8 p=.052). ConclusionND significantly discourages PA and limits SS. Future research should focus on developing strategies to overcoming these negative environmental factors. •Neighborhood disadvantage, crime, and incivilities discourage PA and social support.•Social support did not mediate disadvantage, crime, incivilities, and PA.•Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with social support.•Social support is a potential strategy for overcoming neighborhood disadvantage.•Strategies for overcoming negative environment barriers to PA are needed.},

abstract = {ObjectiveNeighborhood disadvantage (ND), incivilities, and crime disproportionately impact minority women, discouraging physical activity (PA). Social support (SS) is a cultural tool promoting PA in minority women. Socially supportive environments may promote PA in disadvantaged neighborhoods, yet few studies have investigated the mediating role of social support among minority women. This study examined SS as a mediator among ND, incivilities, crime, and PA. MethodsThe Health Is Power study aimed to increase PA in African American and Hispanic Latina women (N=410) in Houston and Austin, TX. ND and crime data were taken from the National Neighborhood Crime Study. Incivilities were measured using the Pedestrian Environment Data Scan (PEDS). SS was measured using the Family and Friend Support for Exercise Habits scale and physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Linear regression analysis was used to examine SS as a mediator following the Baron and Kenny method. ResultsND was negatively associated with PA and SS. SS was not a mediator as it was not significantly associated with ND, crime, and incivilities (F(3,264)=2.02, p{\textgreater}.05) or PA (F(1,266)=3.8 p=.052). ConclusionND significantly discourages PA and limits SS. Future research should focus on developing strategies to overcoming these negative environmental factors. •Neighborhood disadvantage, crime, and incivilities discourage PA and social support.•Social support did not mediate disadvantage, crime, incivilities, and PA.•Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with social support.•Social support is a potential strategy for overcoming neighborhood disadvantage.•Strategies for overcoming negative environment barriers to PA are needed.},

abstract = {Economies of scale are a standard topic in economic theory, frequently applied, for example, in the analysis of monopolies. They exist when a firm optimising its production costs while facing some fixed costs enjoys lower per-unit production costs as the production increases. Similarly to other production units municipalities have to be large enough to minimise average costs. We analysed the local public services in 205 municipalities with extended powers in the Czech Republic for the first time in this context, using regression analysis, a correlation diagram of local public services and statistical analysis. The paper examines this issue using data from 2008 to 2012. Our analysis showed that economies of scale cannot be clearly identified for local services in municipalities with extended powers in the Czech Republic and that the size of a municipality is not a key factor influencing the provision of local services. },

abstract = {This article provides the first comparison of public sector efficiency in and beyond transition. We compare the comprehensive efficiency scores of 202 local governments in the Czech Republic in the transition period of 1995–1998 and the post-transition period of 2005–2008 and identify the period-specific determinants of local government efficiency. We observe convergence to the best practice frontier but also a growing efficiency gap between small and large governments. In both periods, municipal size and the main fiscal variables qualitatively affect efficiency in the same direction and in line with the fiscal stress hypothesis. Left-wing ideology is only robustly associated with cost inefficiency in the transition period. The geographic distances begin to matter for efficiency only in the post-transition period. },

abstract = {One important factor in many macro-level theories of crime is income inequality. Although research generally shows that low levels of neighborhood income are associated with crime, research studies have been less clear on whether income inequality is a robust, independent predictor of crime, particularly in small area studies, and few studies have explicitly considered income inequality between neighborhoods, and those that do typically focus on homicide. The current study examines whether within and between neighborhood income inequality is associated with variation in violent and property crime. We employ geocoded Uniform Crime Report data from the Indianapolis police department and economic and demographic characteristics of the population from the American Community Survey for 2005–2009. Consistent with prior research, lower levels of income were associated with higher violent and property crime counts. Within-tract income inequality was also associated with higher Uniform Crime Reports violent and property crimes in most models. Results also showed that the ratio of tract income levels to neighboring tracts is associated with variation in crime. Thus, both local and nearby income inequality affect crime. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.},

The findings show that human capital doesn't allocate randomly across the space, but its spatial concentration at the biggest urban centers impacts significantly the income inequality between counties.

abstract = {At least part of the effort toward attainment of health and education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) could come from improvements in efficiency of delivery mechanisms. Hence, it is important to know which countries-or which regions within countries-are able to attain higher MDG outcomes even after controlling for resource inputs. This information can be useful for policymakers and can enable a second-stage analysis of why is it that some regions or countries are doing better than others. This paper reviews the methodology for measuring efficiency of macro systems using the health and education sectors as examples. A simpler characterization of efficiency that is less dependent on econometric specifications is introduced. As an example, this method of measuring efficiency is applied to assess the efficiency of health system outcomes at the district (kabupaten) level in Indonesia. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] },

abstract = {Most countries are grappling with the rising income inequality problem and many governments believe that it is important to reduce income inequality. This is because income inequality is associated with a variety of ‘negative' outcomes (e.g., protest and low citizen well-being). This seemingly common-sense argument hinges on an untested assumption: Changes in a country's level of income inequality affect how its citizens perceive and evaluate income inequality. This article argues that this is not theoretically plausible and shows with evidence from China and Japan from 1995 to 2007, that the income inequality of the context a person is embedded in does not systematically affect his or her perception and evaluation of income inequality. Instead, it is the individual socio-psychological factors that affect individual subjective evaluation of income inequality. Thus, while government officials in China and Japan are quick to implement policies that lower the objective dimensions of income inequality, more efforts should focus on subjective income inequality. Simply using the metric of objective income inequality indices (e.g., Gini ratio) as a measure of policy impact may blindside policy makers to the more important subjective income inequality, that is, how people perceive and evaluate everyday income inequality.},

abstract = {CT: Current wisdom suggests that high or increasing crime levels make communities decline. Researchers usually translate decline to mean an increasing desire to move or higher actual mobility of residents; weaker attachments of residents to, and satisfaction with, their neighborhood; less local involvement; and lower house values. Empirical research confirms only some of this wisdom. Crime relates as expected to house prices, neighborhood satisfaction, and the desire to move. But research simultaneously suggests that crime neither spurs mobility nor necessarily decreases local involvement. Past research fails to differentiate the impacts of specific crime rates and does not examine impacts of static versus changing crime rates. This article examines impacts of past and changing crime levels on changes in relative house values and vacancy rates in Baltimore, Maryland, neighborhoods in the 1970s. The results reveal that different crimes influence different aspects of the housing market. Past and changing crime rates play roles in ecological transitions of neighbor-hoods. In keeping with the current findings of contingent impacts of racial change on mobility, I suggest that impacts of crime and related problems on neighborhood viability may be contingent on personal, historical, and locale-specific factors.},

Experts consider this outcome the key indicator of impaired local supervisory control, and past work has confirmed its critical role in linking community structure to crime and victimization outcomes. The investigation responds to recent calls to learn more about impacts of crime on key community processes. Analyses of Philadelphia survey, census, violent crime, and delinquency data find strong impacts of SES. Impacts of crime and delinquency are significant but depend on how they are separated from SES. Influences of the spatially lagged outcome and partialled SES highlight connections between public and parochial control dynamics.

It aims to discover to what extent inefficiency arises from both quality considerations and external factors beyond the organization's control, or alternatively, how much inefficiency is due to inadequate resource management. As a component of inadequate resource management, we test the existence of political-budgetary cycles in the temporal evolution of inefficiencies. The results show that on the whole there is still a wide margin within which local government efficiency and quality levels could be increased, although it is revealed that a great deal of inefficiency is due to exogenous or noncontrollable factors. In particular, it has been found that the size of the municipality, the per capita tax revenue, the per capita grants and the amount of commercial activity are some of the factors related with local government efficiency. },

For this purpose, we have consulted literature in regional economics and the multidisciplinary field of rural studies. In order to analyse to which extent these theories are supported by empirical evidence, we have applied the method of pattern-matching to 18 case studies in leading and lagging rural regions in the EU. The matching results show that the mixed exogenous/endogenous development approach, the community-led development theory and the first hypothesis of Bryden's theory on the exploitation of social and cultural capital are widely supported by empirical evidence from the case studies. Broadly speaking, these theories relate economic development-given the availability of labour and capital-to a high capacity of local actors and strong internal and external networks. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Huge investments have been made in improving the health system of India since early independence, which has resulted in health outcomes such as infant and maternal maternity rates and life expectancy levels to exhibit impressive reductions and increments, respectively. Although at the national level these have been impressive, it is appalling at the state level. States such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu have always topped in displaying low infant and maternal mortality rates associated with high levels of health workers and infrastructure in contrast to states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. In the present study, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess and compare the health system across states of India. Using DEA, we attempt to derive desired levels of health manpower and infrastructure to be emulated, to make the health systems efficient. The study limits to two outputs and two inputs for 27 states of India and used the output oriented DEA. It was found that of the 27 states only six of them were technically efficient, having an efficiency score of 1.00. The remaining states were technically inefficient and were using more than required amount of inputs to achieve the current levels of output. These inefficient states could make their health system efficient by following the efficient states as peers.},

The gap between per capita incomes of the richest and poorest countries is narrowed but still large--the top decile of countries (weighted by population size) is more than six times greater than the lowest decile. Considerable redistribution of income between countries is implied in the assumptions, and it is argued that redistribution within countries must accompany the brake on growth.

There is a statistical and empirical rule that if the number of performance measures is high in comparison with the number of units, then a large percentage of the units will be determined as efficient, which is obviously a questionable result. It also implies that the selection of performance measures is very crucial for successful applications. In this paper, we extend both multiplier and envelopment forms of data envelopment analysis models and propose two alternative approaches for selecting performance measures under variable returns to scale. The multiplier form of selecting model leads to the maximum efficiency scores and the maximum discrimination between efficient units is achieved by applying the envelopment form. Also individual unit and aggregate models are formulated separately to develop the idea of selective measures. Finally, in order to illustrate the potential of the proposed approaches a case study using a data from a banking industry in the Czech Republic is utilized.},

The post-1997 Asian crisis and democratic Indonesia mimic the global trend of disconnection between wages and productivity: labour productivity continues to rise while real wage-earning stagnates or declines. This disconnection has three consequences. First, it affects income or earning distribution as confirmed by rising overall earnings inequality. Second, while it explains the conventional wisdom of an economy-wide negative relationship between real wages and employment, it is of concern that these two variables do not move in the same direction as the productivity improvements that have occurred in large and medium establishments in the manufacturing sector. Third, the disconnection between productivity and earnings growth opens a new discussion on the broader issue of quality of growth, as the data show that robust economic growth in the post-crisis Indonesia has not been accompanied by parallel improvements in the quality of employment.},

The role of spatial spillover associated with the infrastructure–economy relationship has received increasing attention in the literature. Surprisingly, in previous studies, the potential spatial spillover effect of transportation infrastructure on economic output in the U.S. agricultural sector has not been taken into account given the sector's importance in the economy and dependence on transportation. The broader effects, including the direct effect and spatial spillover effect, of transportation infrastructure on agricultural output across 44 states in the United States from 1981 to 2004 are estimated in this study. A spatial Durbin panel data model that catches spatial dependence in both dependent and explanatory variables is used. The results suggest that road disbursement in a given state has positive direct effects on its own agricultural output. Also, the spillover effect of road infrastructure on agricultural output in neighboring states varies with respect to the spatial weight matrix used in the model. Moreover, our analysis shows that enhancement in road infrastructure in the states in the U.S. central region has a larger positive spillover effect on agricultural output when compared to coastal or border states.},

abstract = {There is strong evidence that increases in wage inequality are driven by a steady increase in the relative demand for skilled labor, which is greater than supply. The impact of immigration and women entering the labor market is discussed.;Supply-side factors may contribute to rising wage inequality. First, certain changes in the supply of skills allegedly exacerbate wage inequality. Women's increased labor force participation and increased immigration are the leading candidates; both allegedly reduce the wages of less-skilled men. However, immigration's impact on wage inequality has been minor and the effects of women's participation is inconclusive. Second, in evaluating the likelihood that human capital investment will mitigate future inequality, evidence suggests that rising returns to education have increased the proportion of young people attending college, limiting the growth of inequality among high-wage workers.;},

abstract = {Crimes are treacherous and common social problem faced worldwide. Crimes affect the quality of life, economic growth, and reputation of a nation. There has been an enormous increase in crime rate in the last few years. In order to reduce the crime rate, the law enforcements need to take the preventive measures. With the aim of securing the society from crimes, there is a need for advanced systems and new approaches for improving the crime analytics for protecting their communities. Accurate real-time crime predictions help to reduce the crime rate but remains challenging problem for the scientific community as crime occurrences depend on many complex factors. In this work, various visualizing techniques and machine learning algorithms are adopted for predicting the crime distribution over an area. In the first step, the raw datasets were processed and visualized based on the need. Afterwards, machine learning algorithms were used to extract the knowledge out of these large datasets and discover the hidden relationships among the data which is further used to report and discover the crime patterns that is valuable for crime analysts to analyse these crime networks by the means of various interactive visualizations for crime prediction and hence is supportive in prevention of crimes.},

abstract = {This article provides a political explanation for the unexpectedly high levels of income inequality found in the African region today. Traditional explanations for inequality are reviewed and found not to be compelling. Instead, it is argued that natural endowments in the region shaped the nature of colonial institutions, which in turn created the conditions for the high levels of inequality found today The surprisingly high levels of inequality, in Africa can be understood as resulting from a process of class formation linked to dynamics of state building that have their origins in the economic institutions of the early colonial state. Insofar as political power has often been used to gain economic advantages during the postcolonial era, inequality has changed little over the past 40 years, despite the official focus on development and poverty alleviation by donors and governments alike.},

abstract = {Spatial econometrics has recently been appraised in a theme issue of the Journal of Regional Science. Partridge et al. (2012) provide an overview of the three contributing papers, the most critical being Gibbons and Overman (2012). Although some of the critiques raised are valid, they are issues that can be overcome by improving applied spatial econometric work. There has been excessive use of so-called global spillover models and too much emphasis on statistical testing procedures. Theory or the specific context of the empirical application should be the main guide for specifying a model. Especially the so-called SLX model merits more attention, as it produces local spillovers that are different for each explanatory variable in the equation and it allows for the parameterization of the spatial weights matrix W. The latter is a key contribution since a major concern of spatial econometric modeling, as is thoroughly discussed in Corrado and Fingleton (2012), is the a priori specification of W. This paper highlights these issues with an empirical application and recently proposed approaches for selecting a model specification, which are useful and promising steps forward for applied work involving spatial econometrics.},

This paper reviews and develops some simple models that capture these first and second nature economic geographies. The presence of increasing returns to scale in cities leads to urban structures that are not optimally sized. This depresses the return to job creation, possibly retarding development. Looking at the wider regional structure, development can be associated with large shifts in the location of activity as industry goes from being inward looking to being export oriented.},

abstract = {  This paper applies the Inclusive Growth framework to the OECD Regional Well-being Database in order to compute multidimensional living standards (MDLS) among OECD regions from the early 2000s to 2012. MDLS are based on the equivalent income approach, where, for different income groups, the monetised value of health status and unemployment are added to disposable income and aggregated with a generalised mean function to allow inequality to be taken into account. Results highlight that, due to the spatial concentration of good and bad outcomes, regional disparities are amplified when observed through the lens of MDLS as opposed to income-based regional disparities. The paper also shows that people living in metropolitan regions experienced, on average, higher levels of MDLS but also a sharper decline during the economic crisis. Growth of MDLS in metropolitan regions during this period was characterised by a higher contribution of life expectancy and a lower contribution of income inequality with respect to the other regions.},

Based on a more homogeneous panel data set of US states we constructed, this note applies the model selection procedure to identify the determinants of health expenditures at the state level. We find that the four key factors are gross state products, the proportion of the population over the age of 65, the degree of urbanization and the number of hospital beds. The cross-section income elasticity of health care is around 0.7, implying that health care is a necessity rather than a luxury good at the state level. The (relative) price of health care varies significantly across states but does not appear to have real effects on the amount of resources (measured in real dollars) a state devotes to health care},

Whilst some have argued for larger-area inequality measures to be used there are good theoretical, empirical and intuitive grounds to think that local inequality may have relevance as a driver of social ills. This paper explores whether differing understandings of ?local? inequality does?or can?matter and, if so, within which contexts this is the case. Contrasting findings across the two areas support the notion that local inequality does have relevance to social outcomes but that the socio-spatial context matters.},

abstract = {Whether or not the scale of a society's income inequality is a determinant of population health is still regarded as a controversial issue. We decided to review the evidence and see if we could find a consistent interpretation of both the positive and negative findings. We identified 168 analyses in 155 papers reporting research findings on the association between income distribution and population health, and classified them according to how far their findings supported the hypothesis that greater income differences are associated with lower standards of population health. Analyses in which all adjusted associations between greater income equality and higher standards of population health were statistically significant and positive were classified as "wholly supportive"; if none were significant and positive they were classified as "unsupportive"; and if some but not all were significant and supportive they were classified as "partially supportive". Of those classified as either wholly supportive or unsupportive, a large majority (70 per cent) suggest that health is less good in societies where income differences are bigger. There were substantial differences in the proportion of supportive findings according to whether inequality was measured in large or small areas. We suggest that the studies of income inequality are more supportive in large areas because in that context income inequality serves as a measure of the scale of social stratification, or how hierarchical a society is. We suggest three explanations for the unsupportive findings reported by a minority of studies. First, many studies measured inequality in areas too small to reflect the scale of social class differences in a society; second, a number of studies controlled for factors which, rather than being genuine confounders, are likely either to mediate between class and health or to be other reflections of the scale of social stratification; and third, the international relationship was temporarily lost (in all but the youngest age groups) during the decade from the mid-1980s when income differences were widening particularly rapidly in a number of countries. We finish by discussing possible objections to our interpretation of the findings. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {I consider the problem of estimating the effect of a health care reform on the frequency of individual doctor visits when the reform effect is potentially different in different parts of the outcome distribution. Quantile regression is a powerful method for studying such heterogeneous treatment effects. Only recently has this method been extended to situations where the dependent variable is a (non-negative integer) count. An analysis of a 1997 health care reform in Germany shows that lower quantiles, such as the first quartile, fell by substantially larger amounts than what would have been predicted based on Poisson or negative binomial models.},

India's economic salience is also on the rise. Together, these two countries will profoundly influence the pace and nature of global economic change. Drawing upon the latest research, this timely new book analyzes the influences on the rapid future development of these two countries and examines how their growth is likely to impinge upon other countries. It considers international trade, industrialization, foreign investment, and capital flows, and the implications of their broadening environmental footprints. It also discusses how the two countries have tackled poverty, inequality and governance issues and whether progress in these areas will be a key to rapid and stable growth.;This report takes a dispassionate and critical look at the rise of China and India, and asks questions about this growth: Where is it occurring? Who is benefiting most? Is it sustainable? And what are the implications for the rest of the world? The book considers whether the giants' growth will be seriously constrained by weaknesses in governance, growing inequality, and environmental stresses, and it concludes that this need not occur. However, it does suggest that the Chinese and Indian authorities face important challenges in keeping their investment climates favorable, their inequalities at levels that do not undermine growth, and their air and water quality at acceptable levels. The authors also consider China's and India's interactions with the global trading and financial systems and their impact on the global commons, particularly with regard to climate. The book finds that the giants' growth and trade offer most countries opportunities to gain economically. However, many countries will face strong adjustment pressure in manufacturing, particularly those with competing exports and especially if the giants' technical progress is strongly export- enhancing. For a few countries, mainly in Asia, these pressures could outweigh the economic benefits of larger markets in, and cheaper imports from, the giants; and the growth of those countries over the next fifteen years will be slightly lower as a result. The giants will contribute to the increase in world commodity and energy prices but they are not the principal cause of higher oil prices. The giants' emissions of CO2 will grow strongly, especially if economic growth is not accompanied by steps to enhance energy efficiency. At present, a one-time window of opportunity exists for achieving substantial efficiency improvements if ambitious current and future investment plans embody appropriate standards. Moreover, doing so will not be too costly or curtail growth significantly. From their relatively small positions at present, the giants will emerge as significant players in the world financial system as they grow and liberalize. Rates of reserve asset accumulation likely will slow, and emerging pressures will encourage China to reduce its current account surplus.;China is now the world's fourth largest economy and growing very fast. India's economic salience is also on the rise. Together these two countries will profoundly influence the pace and nature of global economic change.

This paper attempts to augment this literature on performance measurement in Australian local government by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) with holistic indices of allocative and technical efficiency in New South Wales (NSW) municipal water services. It also seeks to incorporate qualitative indicators into efficiency measures. “Best‐practice” councils are identified and the underlying causes of municipal water service efficiency are analyzed. },

abstract = {This graduate text provides an intuitive but rigorous treatment of contemporary methods used in microeconometric research. The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

abstract = {Local government in advanced economies is undergoing a period of rapid reform aimed at enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Accordingly, the definition, measurement and improvement of organisational performance is crucial. Despite the importance of efficiency measurement in local government it is only relatively recently that econometric and mathematical frontier techniques have been applied to local public services. This paper attempts to provide a synoptic survey of the comparatively few empirical analyses of efficiency measurement in local government. We examine both the measurement of inefficiency in local public services and the determinants of local public sector efficiency. The implications of efficiency measurement for practitioners in local government are examined by way of conclusion. },

abstract = {This study employs four data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to evaluate the performance efficiency of 21 OECD countries and assess whether the undesirable outputs are over-produced relative to desirable outputs. In evaluating the performance of OECD countries via super-efficiency models, this study focuses on two aspects. First, employing the concept of the Sharpe ratio, we propose another method to deal with undesirable outputs (the unemployment rate, inflation, and air pollution) in DEA. This approach can reveal the relative importance of desirable outputs and undesirable outputs, detect whether undesirable outputs are over-produced, and obtain more accurate efficiency scores. Second, we examine whether knowledge capital can improve a country's efficiency scores. Our empirical results support the above arguments. In addition, research and development (R{\&}D) expenditures, the proxy variable for knowledge capital, can indeed improve countries' efficiency scores, implying that the endogenous growth theory is supported in OECD countries. Evidently, whether the undesirable outputs are included in the DEA models and are properly treated is crucial in the evaluation of efficiency values. },

Is neighborhood fear spatially lagged, and if so, does controlling for nearby fear alter endogenous impacts on fear? Survey data from 45 Philadelphia neighborhoods showed that those perceiving more incivilities and more crime risk than their neighbors were more fearful. Furthermore, neighborhoods where residents on average saw more crime risk were on average more fearful, even after controlling for significantly auto-correlated nearby neighborhood fear. The results suggest that impacts of incivilities on fear at the individual level are not completely mediated by perceived risk and that average fear levels in nearby neighborhoods correlate significantly, suggesting that some localized processes are operating above the neighborhood level. What these are, and how they link to neighborhood- and individual-level dynamics, remains to be investigated. {\textless}/p{\textgreater} },

The main findings include: (1) Transport infrastructure and economic growth of China show an evident pattern of spatial clustering. They largely congregate in developed eastern coastal regions, forming a gradient gradually diminishing from east to west. (2) Output elasticity of local transport infrastructure is 0.106, between the values calculated by early researchers with time series data and panel data.

abstract = {Previous studies focused on identifying the determinants of mortality in US counties have examined the relationships between mortality and explanatory covariates within a county only and have ignored the well‐documented spatial dependence of mortality. We challenge earlier literature by arguing that the mortality rate of a certain county may also be associated with the features of its neighbouring counties beyond its own features. Drawing from both the spillover (i.e. same‐direction effect) and social relativity (i.e. opposite‐direction effect) perspectives, our spatial Durbin modelling results indicate that both theoretical perspectives provide valuable frameworks to guide the modelling of mortality variation in US counties. Our empirical findings support that the mortality rate of a certain county is associated with the features of its neighbours. Specifically, we found support for the spillover perspective in which the percentage of the Hispanic population, concentrated disadvantage, and the social capital of a specific county are negatively associated with the mortality rate in the specific county and also in neighbouring counties. On the other hand, the following covariates fit the social relativity process: health insurance coverage, percentage of non‐Hispanic other races, and income inequality. Their direction of the associations with mortality in the specific county is opposite to that of the relationships with mortality in neighbouring counties. Methodologically, spatial Durbin modelling addresses the shortcomings of traditional analytic approaches used in ecological mortality research such as ordinary least squares, spatial error, and spatial lag regression. Our results produce new insights drawn from unbiased estimates. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. },

Empirical results show that effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors and demographic structure on education and health outcomes are similar to those in previous studies. The results indicate two important findings. First, public education and health expenditures remain incapable to explain outcomes when compared to other socioeconomic variables. Second, increase in public education and health expenditures is associated with improved outcomes just in countries where regulatory quality and control of corruption is high.

The subsequent estimating using Anselin's spatial lag model determines the important sources of growth to be the growth of non-farm labor force, manufactured products, capital stock, and realized direct foreign investment.

abstract = {This paper examines the possibility of spatial spillover effects of transport infrastructure in Chinese regions. We estimate the regional spillovers of the transport infrastructure stock by applying a spatial Durbin Model for the time-period 1978–2009, and also three sub-periods, 1978–1990, 1991–2000 and 2001–2009. The results indicate that positive spillovers exist in each period due to the connectivity characteristic of transport infrastructure at the national level. At the regional level, transport infrastructure spillover effects vary considerably over time among China's four macro-regions: the eastern region enjoyed positive spillovers all the time; the northeastern region had no significant spillover effects in 1978–1990, negative spillovers in 1991–2000, and positive spillovers in 2001–2009; the central region had negative spillovers for the three sub-periods; for the western region, negative spillovers can be observed after the 1990s. The analysis indicates that changes in spillovers among regions are closely associated with the migration of production factors in China during the last decades.},

A Spatial Markov Chain is used to identify the dynamics of regional wealth disparity in Zhejiang. The results show that the regional inequality of Zhejiang is sensitive to the geographic scale of the analysis. In addition, the inter-county inequality shows an inverted-U shape pattern. At the same time, the inter-municipality inequality displays a more consistently upward trend, and the evolution of the interregional inequality is relatively stable over time. The regional inequality is more significant at finer (larger) spatial scales. The decomposition of the Theil Index shows that the contribution of the inequalities between Northeast Zhejiang and Southwest Zhejiang increased. The increasingly larger values of the Global Moran's I show that there is an intensifying spatial aggregation of economic development. The comparison of the traditional Markov transition matrix and the Spatial Markov transition matrix illustrates how the relative wealth or poverty of neighboring counties make a significance difference in wealth in a given county as measured using domestic GDP per capita in Zhejiang province.

abstract = {This handbook compiles state-of-the-art empirical studies and applications using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It includes a collection of 18 chapters written by DEA experts. Chapter 1 examines the performance of CEOs of U.S. banks and thrifts. Chapter 2 describes the network operational structure of transportation organizations and the relative network data envelopment analysis model. Chapter 3 demonstrates how to use different types of DEA models to compute total-factor energy efficiency scores with an application to energy efficiency. In chapter 4, the authors explore the impact of incorporating customers' willingness to pay for service quality in benchmarking models on cost efficiency of distribution networks, and chapter 5 provides a brief review of previous applications of DEA to the professional baseball industry, followed by two detailed applications to Major League Baseball. Chapter 6 examines efficiency and productivity of U.S. property-liability (P-L) insurers using DEA, while chapter 7 presents a two-stage network DEA model that decomposes the overall efficiency of a decision-making unit into two components. Chapter 8 presents a review of the literature of DEA models for the perfoemance assessment of mutual funds, and chapter 9 discusses the management strategies formulation of the international tourist hotel industry in Taiwan. Chapter 10 presents a novel use of the two-stage network DEA to evaluate sustainable product design performances. In chapter 11 authors highlight limitations of some DEA environmental efficiency models, and chapter 12 reviews applications of DEA in secondary and tertiary education. Chapter 13 measures the relative performance of New York State school districts in the 2011-2012 academic year. Chapter 14 provides an introductory prelude to chapters 15 and 16, which both provide detailed applications of DEA in marketing. Chapter 17 then shows how to decompose a new total factor productivity index that satisfies all economically-relevant axioms from index theory with an application to U.S. agriculture. Finally, chapter 18 presents a unique study that conducts a DEA research front analysis, applying a network clustering method to group the DEA literature over the period 2000 to 2014. },

abstract = {The existence of geographic differences in health resources, health expenditures, the utilization of health services, and health outcomes have been documented by a lot of studies from various countries of the world. In a publicly financed health system, equal access is one of the main objectives of the national health policy. That is why inequalities in the geographic allocation of health resources are an important health policy issue. Measures of inequality express the complexity of variation in the observed variable by a single number, and there is a variety of inequality measures available. The objective of this study is to develop a measure of the geographic inequality in the case of multiple health resources. The measure uses data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric method of production function estimation, to transform multiple resources into a single virtual health resource. The study shows that the DEA originally developed for measuring efficiency can be used successfully to measure inequality. For the illustrative purpose, the inequality measure is calculated for the Czech Republic. The values of separate Robin Hood Indexes (RHIs) are 6.64{\%} for physicians and 3.96{\%} for nurses. In the next step, we use combined RHI for both health resources. Its value 5.06{\%} takes into account that the combinations of two health resources serve regional populations. },

abstract = {The findings of recent studies on adjustment processes suggest that regional labour markets in the EU and the US differ significantly. Low wage flexibility and limited labour mobility in European countries involve persistent unemployment differentials across regions. However, the spatial dimension of regional labour market problems is largely neglected in the corresponding analyses. In contrast, the present paper focuses on the spatial structure of regional unemployment disparities. Regions are tightly linked by migration, commuting and interregional trade. These types of spatial interaction are exposed to the frictional effects of distance, possibly causing the spatial dependence of regional labour market conditions. The spatial association of regional unemployment is analysed for a sample of European countries between 1986 and 2000 by measures of spatial autocorrelation and spatial econometric methods. The results indicate that there is a significant degree of spatial dependence among regional labour markets in Europe. Regions marked by high unemployment as well as areas characterised by low unemployment tend to cluster in space. The findings suggest that different forms of spatial interaction affect the evolution of regional unemployment in Europe.},

An empirical model of Chinese output growth using cross provincial data over the 1978-1998 period is specified, but a spatial econometric analysis of the specification reveals strong evidence of misspecification due to ignored spatial lag dependence. The subsequent estimating using Anselin's spatial lag model determines the important sources of growth to be the growth of non-farm labor force, manufactured products, capital stock, and realized direct foreign investment. On the other hand, the estimated coefficient for the spatial lag variable suggests a polarizing process undergoing within the Chinese spatial economy, and the resulting change in the estimates of causal factors implies that as marketization progresses, a variety of spillover effects due to factor mobility, transfer payments and technological diffusion become operational, which actually improve the marginal productivity of factor inputs for labor (G[subscript L]) and capital (G[subscript K], G[subscript DFI]) and bring national output closer to its frontier of the Chinese economy.},

abstract = {The paper investigates factors that determine the average income growth and net migration rates in Swedish municipalities during 1981-99. The main issue is to test the hypothesis that conditional on a set of other possible determinants of regional growth, the growth rate in one municipality is affected by the growth rates in its neighbouring municipalities. The hypothesis of conditional convergence is also tested. A positive correlation is found between net migration rates in neighbouring municipalities, which suggests that net migration tends to "spillover"; to neighbouring municipalities. When it comes to average income growth, the results indicate spatial dependence in the error terms during the 1980s. However, there is no clear evidence in favour of the hypothesis of conditional convergence. Instead, the results predict conditional divergence between municipalities located in the Stockholm region throughout the period and also for municipalities outside the Stockholm region during the 1990s.

Yet, regions did not benefit equally: poverty declined significantly in all regions but regional income inequality remained stagnant. We found that convergence in per-capita income and productivity levels is too slow to become a significant force in equalizing regional income. Lack of convergence is mostly associated with low levels of internal migration. This, in turn, is found to be largely the result of government policies, in particular, public housing. The efficient targeting of subsidies coupled with the prohibition to sell houses, tied families to their geographical location, inhibiting migration.},

A spatial econometric analysis of the familiar Baumol speci{\textregistered} cation reveals strong evidence of misspeci{\textregistered} cation due to ignored spatial error dependence.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of European regional per capita product over time and space. This purpose is achieved by using the recently developed methods of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis. Using a sample of European regions over the 1980-1995 period, we find strong evidence of global and local spatial autocorrelation in per capita GDP throughout the period. The detection of clusters of high and low per capita products during the period is an indication of the persistence of spatial disparities between European regions. This analysis is finally refined by the investigation of the spatial pattern of regional growth. Key words:exploratory spatial data analysis; distribution of regional per capita GDP; European Union; spatial autocorrelation; regional inequalities},

abstract = {This paper extends the concept of the resource curse by studying whether and through which transmission channels natural resource wealth affects social spending. Even though the availability of vast natural capital reserves has commonly been linked to the neglect of human development, most of the literature has continued to focus on economic performance. This paper is the first to empirically investigate the link between natural resource wealth and public health expenditures in light of the hypothesis that resource wealth as a source of unearned state income enhances state autonomy and increases volatility, which leads to policies that fail to prioritize human development. Using a large panel dataset of world countries covering the period from 1995 to 2009, we find a robust, significant inverse relationship between natural resource dependence, and even abundance, and public health spending over time. The effect remains significant after controlling for state autonomy, volatility, and other factors. These findings have implications for national authorities as well as the extractive industry. Governments should be made accountable for natural resource wealth and correct taxation could provide additional resources, earmarked for health. The extractive industry could increase their investments in sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility operations, specifically in the health sector.},

annote = {which literatura, alternative to growth accounting approach, can be used to explain diffrences across regions in factor accumulation or factor productivity????

even if regions converge in some periods that process can be reverse in anymoment, so the relevant issue is to identify the determinants of income, productivity or product per worker levels.

Public spending has an effect on growth rates, levels or both???

IF the focus is on levels of income the treatmet of turism sector could be relevant...

An important sector is Services (spetialy comerce) were the proximity to resources is crucial (thinking on regional context
